<small>“THE COACHLESS WONDERS”</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">A blue runabout chugged blithely along
Troutman Street, in the town of Clearfield,
one afternoon in mid-September, honking
hoarse warnings at the intersections of other thoroughfares
and rustling the yellow and russet leaves,
which, because of an unprecedently early frost two
nights before, had already sprinkled the pavement.</p>

<p>In the car, clutching the wheel with an assumption
of ease somewhat belied by the frequent frowns
of anxiety which appeared on his face, sat the
proud owner, Richard, or, as some of us already
know him, Dick Lovering. Dick was seventeen
years of age, tall, nice-looking, with dark eyes and
hair and a lean face a trifle more pallid than one
would expect on the driver of an automobile. But
Dick hadn’t had that runabout very long, only about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
a fortnight, in fact, which accounted for his anxiety
at street crossings and corners and, possibly, for the
lack of healthy color in his face.</p>

<p>The car was painted a deep and brilliant blue,
and, appropriately enough, had been dubbed by its
owner “Eli Yale,” answering, however, quite as
readily to “Eli.” Its varnish was as yet unmarred
by scratch or blotch and its brass shone resplendently.
To make no secret of it, the car had been presented
to Dick by the members of the Clearfield
Baseball Club at the completion of a successful season
which had netted the club much money. Dick
had been the manager and had conducted affairs so
capably that the gift was well-deserved. The car
had been bought at a bargain, having been used but
a few days by its previous owner, and was proving
a wonderful blessing to Dick, who was very far
from being wealthy enough to purchase such a luxury
himself. Dick, you see, was not as well able to
get about as other boys, for he had been a cripple
all his life. You’d never have suspected it to see him
guiding Eli around the corner of B Street, for to
all appearances he was quite a normal and healthy
lad. But had you looked on the running-board at
the left of the car you’d have seen a pair of crutches<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
secured there, crutches without which Dick was
quite unable to get around, or had been until the
blue automobile had appeared on the scene.</p>

<p>Morris Brent, who had owned the car first and
whose reckless driving of it had resulted in an upset
and a broken leg, had initiated Dick into the science
of running it and had found him a clever pupil, but
the latter had not yet gained complete confidence and
skill, and so when, just as he was passing the first
house on his right after leaving Troutman Street,
his name was called loudly and unexpectedly, Dick,
glancing startledly about, unintentionally opened the
throttle and Eli fairly bounded forward and was a
quarter of the way down the block before Dick
could bring him to a stop. When the brake was set
and the driver, sighing with relief, looked back along
the tree-bordered street he saw a short and somewhat
stout youth waving and pursuing. Fudge
Shaw—his real name was William, but everyone
outside his family had forgotten the fact—arrived
panting and laughing.</p>

<p>“That was a b-b-bully stop!” he gasped.
(Fudge had an entertaining habit of stuttering in
moments of excitement.) “Going out to the field,
Dick?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<p>“Yes. Climb in.”</p>

<p>Fudge, attired in football togs, seated himself
with a grunt beside the other, slammed the door and
beamed about him. Fudge had very blue and very
round eyes, so round that he constantly wore an expression
of pleasant and somewhat excited surprise.
He also had a good deal of sandy-red hair. He was
ambitious to make the High School Football Team,
was Fudge, and since Spring had refused all entreaties
to have his hair cut. Viewing that mop of
hair one would have doubted the necessity of the
head-guard which he dangled in one hand.</p>

<p>Dick started up again and traveled cautiously yet
briskly through B Street, but not until he had everything
adjusted to his liking and one hand on the
bulb of the horn did he indulge in conversation, although
Fudge, unperplexed by problems of gears
and levers, chattered busily.</p>

<p>“Gordon promised to stop for me,” he confided,
“but he didn’t, and I didn’t know it was so late. I
was writing.”</p>

<p>Fudge paused as though inviting curiosity. Eli
said “Honk! Honk!” hoarsely before he chugged
across Main Street, and Dick asked, “Another
story, Fudge?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span></p>

<p>Fudge nodded carelessly. “Yes, and it’s going
to be a peach. It—it’s a detective story, Dick. I
meant it to be just a short one, but it’s turning out
to be quite long. I guess it’ll be a regular novel before
I get through with it. Detective stories are lots
of fun to write. Maybe I’ll read some of this to you
some time, Dick.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” replied the other gravely. “What’s it
about, Fudge?”</p>

<p>“Oh, about a murder and a peach of a detective
chap named ‘Young Sleuth.’ You see, this old codger
Middleton was found murdered in his library,
surrounded by oodles of money. There was only
one window in the room and that was all barred
over with steel bars. And there was only one door
and that was locked on the inside and they had to
break it open. How’s that for a situation? You
see, having his money all scattered around showed
that he wasn’t killed for that, don’t it? And the
barred window and the door locked on the <em>inside</em>—get
that, Dick? On the <em>inside</em>, mind you!—thickens
the plot a bit, eh?”</p>

<p>“Rather!” agreed Dick, anxiously viewing a
buggy half a block ahead. “How did the murderer
get in, Fudge?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p>“Why, you see—well, I haven’t worked that out
yet,” he confessed. “I’ve just got to where the old
millionaire’s beautiful daughter sends for ‘Young
Sleuth’ to unravel the mystery and bring her father’s
murderer to justice. It’s going to be a peach
of a story, all right!”</p>

<p>“Sounds so,” returned Dick, sighing with relief
as the buggy turned to the right into Common
Street. “You must read it to me when you get it
finished. It wouldn’t be a bad idea to get ‘Young
Sleuth’ to work for us here, Fudge, and find a football
coach.”</p>

<p>“That’s right! Isn’t it the limit for Farrell to
leave us like this? I hope they turn him down good
and hard when he comes back in the Spring and
wants to coach the nine again!”</p>

<p>“I guess he couldn’t do anything else, Fudge.
Farrell’s all right. You or I’d do the same thing
probably if we got word that our mother was very
ill in Ireland and wanted to see us. We’d do just
as Joe did; pack up and go back there.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” agreed Fudge. “But it leaves us in an
awful hole, doesn’t it? Lanny White says he
doesn’t know where to look for a new coach, and
it’s pretty late, too. Mr. Grayson told him he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
guessed we’d better try to do without a coach this
Fall. Just as if we could!”</p>

<p>“I suppose it would be hard,” said Dick. “Gordon
said that Lanny had heard of a man in Bridgeport.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t pan out,” replied Fudge. “He was
a man Bert Cable knew, but he hadn’t ever coached
a football team. Now Lanny’s after a chap in
Westport. He coached Torleston High a couple of
years ago. It’s a bum outlook, say what you want.
Lanny’s going to make a dandy captain, but he
can’t coach too. No one could. There’s the First
Team, and the Scrub Team and the Third Squad.
Maybe if Lanny didn’t do any playing himself he’d
get by all right, but what’s the good of a captain
who doesn’t play? Besides, he’s too good a halfback
to lose.”</p>

<p>“It’s too bad,” observed Dick sympathetically as,
having turned into Common Street, he now drew
the runabout to the side of the road where a gate
appeared in the high board fence surrounding the
athletic field. “By the way, where are you going to
play, Fudge?”</p>

<p>“Me?” Fudge grinned. “Oh, I’m out for a
guard position, but I’ll play anything they’ll let me.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
I’m versatile, I am, Dick! Say, honest, do you
suppose Lanny’ll give me a show?”</p>

<p>“If you show him,” laughed Dick. “Seems,
though, you might be a bit inexperienced for the
First, Fudge.”</p>

<p>“I don’t expect to get on the First—this year.
I want to make the Scrub Team. They say you
get a lot of fun on the Scrub. Experience, too.
They can’t say I’m too light, anyway!”</p>

<p>“No, you’re not that,” agreed Dick as, having
stopped the engine, he secured his crutches, placed
the tips on the ground and swung himself from the
car in the wake of Fudge. “Hope you have luck,
anyway.”</p>

<p>Once past the gate Fudge, with a startled “They’ve
begun, Dick!” scurried off, leaving Dick to make
his way toward where a small group of fellows
were standing along the side line watching the first
practice of the season. Returning greetings, Dick
paused and looked around him. The gridiron had
been freshly marked out and the creamy-white lines
shone brilliantly in the afternoon sunlight against
the green turf. Down near the west goal the First
Squad was jogging about in signal practice in charge
of Chester Cottrell, last year’s quarter. Dick noted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
that, as composed this afternoon, it was made up
entirely of last year’s first and second string players;
Grover, Horsford, Cable, Haley, Kent, Wayland,
Toll, McCoy, Hansard, Cottrell and Felker. Two
of the regulars were absent from the squad; Lanny
White himself, whom Dick soon espied working with
the green candidates, and Morris Brent, who last
year had played fullback in one or two of the principal
games and was this Fall the logical candidate for
the place. Doubtless, though, Dick reflected, Lanny
was keeping Morris out of the game on account of
his injured leg. Morris’s folks had strongly objected
to the boy’s taking part in football this season and
had appealed to the doctor to support them. The
latter, however, to everyone’s surprise, especially
Morris’s, had declared that he didn’t believe kicking a
football around would hurt that leg. It was evident,
though, that Lanny wasn’t going to take chances,
for Dick saw Morris, sweatered, hands in pockets,
speedily following in the wake of the Third Squad
with Lanny. The Scrubs were having practice by
themselves at the east end of the gridiron, and Dick
wondered who was in charge. With the idea of
finding out, he made his way leisurely along the side
line and, after traversing a few yards, was overtaken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
by George Cotner, the manager, a squarely built
and stocky youth of eighteen with an alert countenance.</p>

<p>“Hello, Dick,” greeted Cotner. “Come out to see
the Orphans play?”</p>

<p>“Is that what you call them?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“That or the Coachless Wonders,” was the smiling
response. “Isn’t it the dickens about Farrell?
Mean trick to play on us, I say.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess he didn’t mean to play any trick.
Guess he’d much rather have stayed here in Clearfield
and coached the team than have been called
home to see his sick mother.”</p>

<p>Cotner shrugged his shoulders. “If he <em>was</em> called
home,” he said.</p>

<p>“Well, wasn’t he? That’s what I heard. What
do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean that Joe wasn’t getting much money
here, as you probably know, Dick, and he’s a pretty
good coach. His contract expired this Fall and it
hadn’t been renewed. The Athletic Committee was
ready to renew it, but Joe didn’t show up. Then
came that letter saying his mother was ill in Ireland
and he was going home to visit her. It just occurred
to me that maybe his mother was another school<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
somewhere and that he was after more money.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t think that of Joe,” answered Dick,
shaking his head. “Joe was always terribly loyal to
Clearfield, George. Besides, he could easily have
told the Committee if he thought he wasn’t getting
enough salary.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and the Committee would have told him that
he was getting all the school could afford to pay him.
Well, I don’t know anything about it, more than I’ve
been told, but that idea occurred to me. Lanny’s
worried stiff about it. He’s had three different men
on the string and not one of them has been landed.
Two wouldn’t think of the job at the salary and the
third had never done any football coaching. That
was Bert Cable’s man, a fellow over in Bridgeport
named Mooney. I guess we’d been moony if we’d
taken him. It’s tough on Lanny, though. He’s trying
to look after three squads at once and doesn’t
really know what to do with any of them. And now
Grayson is making a talk about getting along without
any coach at all! And some of the grads on the
Committee are more than half agreed with him.
They say we haven’t much money and what we have
we ought to use in fixing the field up and building
a new grandstand. Wouldn’t that jar you? Fancy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
trying to turn out a winning eleven without a coach!
And this is our year to beat Springdale—if we’re
ever going to do it again.”</p>

<p>George Cotner scowled across the gridiron a
moment and then continued with his grievance.
“We’ve got pretty fair material this year, too, Dick,
and we ought to come out on top, especially if
Morris Brent comes around in good shape and turns
out the drop-kicker and punter he threatened to be
last year. But we ought to have a good coach to
look after him. Lanny’s afraid to let him practice
for fear something will happen to his bum leg again,
and afraid to keep him out of practice for fear he
won’t get in shape for Springdale. Even if Lanny
could coach the First Team, there ought to be someone
to look after the others. There’s the Scrub down
there running around like chickens with their heads
off, going through signals when they ought to be
handling the ball and learning the a, b, c’s. Harry
Partridge is trying to captain them, but he doesn’t
know anything about it. He’s a good guard, but
he’s never had any responsibility and he’s terribly
unhappy right now. Besides, hang it all, we ought
to be mapping out a campaign. But when I tell
Lanny that he looks wild and runs his hands<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
through his hair and says he has all he can attend to
without bothering with plans. Why, if we had——”</p>

<p>But Manager Cotner’s speech was rudely interrupted
by a football which, wandering erratically off
the field, collided violently with the small of his back.
By the time he had chased it and returned it at a
round-arm throw to Pete Robey he had lost the
thread of his discourse. The Scrub Team trotted
past at that moment and Dick answered the waving
hand of Gordon Merrick who was playing right half
on that eleven.</p>

<p>“Want to see you after practice,” called Gordon.
“Don’t go away. Important!”</p>

<p>“Me, too!” shouted Will Scott. “I want a ride
home just as much as he does, Dick!”</p>

<p>Dick laughed and turned again to George Cotner
who was ruffling the leaves of the red-covered memorandum
book he carried. “It seems to me,” he said,
“that some one of the graduates ought to come out
and coach.”</p>

<p>“Sure, but there aren’t any; any who know football
well enough to teach it, I mean. And that isn’t
all, either. A coach has got to know how to get the
work out of the fellows, and he’s got to be able to
plan like a—like a regular planner, and scheme like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
a regular schemer. Take Joe Farrell, now. Joe
isn’t exactly a brainy fellow, and he isn’t what you’d
call well-educated, but, by Jove, Joe used to have
the whole season all mapped out long before practice
began. When he started he knew just what he was
going to work for, and he worked for it. And got
it—usually.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he was all right,” Dick agreed. “Wish he
was coming back. I suppose, though, if he does
come it’ll be too late for this season. Do you mean,
George, that there isn’t a high school graduate in
Clearfield able to coach the team? It doesn’t sound
possible.”</p>

<p>“Well, name one! Name one and I’ll go and
fetch him out here. All the good players have gone
away, I guess. Lanny and I got a catalogue the
other day and went through the alumnæ and
couldn’t find a football man in the lot; no one we
knew anything about, anyway. Of course, we might
get some of the fellows who are in college to come
back for a few days at a time and help, but that
wouldn’t cut much ice. No, sir, you’ve got to have
someone in charge, someone at the head. Even if he
doesn’t know an awful lot of football he’s <em>there</em>; if
you see what I mean.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<p>“I understand,” said Dick. “Wish I could think
of someone.”</p>

<p>“So do I. Wish I could. Just to show how
things get by when there’s no one around to take
charge, look at the dummy.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see it,” responded Dick, his gaze traveling
across to where the two uprights and cross-bar stood
empty.</p>

<p>“That’s just it. If Farrell had been here the
dummy would have been up and ready for use. I
never thought of it. Neither did Lanny. He told
the First Squad to go over and tackle and when they
got there there was nothing to tackle. It’s stowed
away in the gym.”</p>

<p>“Life is indeed filled with woe, George,” laughed
Dick.</p>

<p>“Well, it is,” grumbled the other, smiling a little
nevertheless. “Lanny jumped on me because the
old thing wasn’t hung.”</p>

<p>“Well, as manager of the football team—” began
Dick slyly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know. I ought to have seen to it. But
there you are. I never had seen to it and didn’t think
of it. Everything’s the same way. We haven’t got
balls enough, we’re short of blankets and—and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
everything! I’m going to resign if we don’t get a
coach inside of a week!”</p>

<p>“I dare say you will have one,” said Dick soothingly.
“Someone will turn up, you’ll see.”</p>

<p>“Where from?” grunted George. “Maybe you’d
like the job, Dick?”</p>

<p>“Why, I don’t know,” replied the other thoughtfully.
“Perhaps—perhaps I should, George. I
might think it over.”</p>

<p>Cotner laughed, and then, seeing Dick’s sober
countenance, said hurriedly: “Well, I dare say you
could do it, by Jove! The fellows tell me you managed
that baseball club to the King’s taste, Dick.
Still, I don’t suppose you know much football.”</p>

<p>“No more football than baseball, George, and I’ve
never played either.”</p>

<p>“No, of course not.” George shot a puzzled
glance at him. “Well, you knew enough baseball,
it seems. As far as I’m concerned, I’d be mighty
willing to see you try it, Dick!”</p>

<p>“Thanks. Maybe if no one else turns up I’ll apply
for the position.” Dick ended smilingly and George
Cotner wondered how seriously the other meant what
he had said.</p>

<p>“After all,” he said doubtfully, and apparently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
with a desire to be pleasant, “a coach doesn’t need
to have been any great shucks himself as a player.
It’s—it’s brains and—leadership that do the business,
I guess.”</p>

<p>“They help, I fancy,” replied Dick, gravely. “I
think Lanny is yelling for you, George.”</p>

<small>DICK RECEIVES AN INVITATION</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Clearfield is a fairly typical New England
mill town, lying some two miles in from
the coast. Doubtless the early settlers had
been attracted by the water power to be derived from
the river which flows around the town on the north.
Certainly, they could not have been influenced by
æsthetic or sanitary considerations, for the town occupies
what must have been in their time a more or
less level meadow a few feet above the river and a
very few more above the sea, and, aside from the
possibility of good drainage—which probably never
occurred to them—those first residents of the future
Clearfield found few natural advantages and little
of the picturesque. To be sure, northward and westward
the country breaks into low hills and is attractive
enough, but a distant view of those hills<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
could scarcely have made up for mosquitoes and
malaria, for Needham’s Mill, as the first settlement
was called, was surrounded by marsh.</p>

<p>However, the Clearfield of to-day is no longer
Needham’s Mill. The marshes have disappeared—although
it is still no uncommon thing to strike a
peat-bed when excavating for a cellar—and there is
a small-sized city of some seventeen thousand inhabitants,
with broad, well-shaded streets, some fine
buildings and many manufactories. Clearfield is
famous for its knitting mills, but has divers other
industries as well. The railroad crosses Mill River
from the north, and the trains stop at a new and commodious
station, post-card pictures of which you can
purchase at Wadsworth’s Book Store and at Castle’s
Pharmacy. It is no longer quite correct to say that
the river flows around the town, for within the past
ten or fifteen years the town has crossed the river and
the larger mills and the boat-yards are built along
the stream in what is known as the North Side and
which is reached by two well-built bridges. Clearfield
is served by a trolley system, and, if one wants
to reach the shore he may step into a big yellow-sided
car at Town Square and be whisked to Rutter’s
Point, where the summer hotel and the cottages face<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
the ocean, in a very few minutes. The Common, a
square of turf bisected by paths and set with benches
and a band-stand, occupying a block in the older part
of town, is the center of the business section. Facing
the Common are Clearfield’s best and newest business
blocks and the Town Hall and the post office,
and it was toward the Common that Dick Lovering
conducted Eli and Gordon Merrick at the conclusion
of football practice.</p>

<p>Gordon was fifteen years old, a very live-looking
boy with clean-cut features, dark hair and eyes and
a well-built, athletic figure. He and Dick were very
good friends, and on the way in from the field they
had found so much of strictly personal interest to
discuss that after Dick had drawn up before the
post office he remembered, while Gordon had gone
inside for some stamps, that the latter had quite
neglected to mention the important matter he had
alluded to at the field. Tom Haley, a big, powerful-looking
boy of sixteen who played center on the
school team, stopped to talk a moment. Tom was
pessimistic to-day.</p>

<p>“Lanny had us doing signal work most of the
afternoon,” he said. “He’s putting the cart before
the horse, Dick, for half of us can’t handle the ball<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
yet without dropping it. When are we going to get
someone to coach? Heard anything about it?”</p>

<p>“I heard to-day that Lanny was trying to get a
man in Westport who has been coaching Torleston
High School. That’s all I know, Tom.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it’ll be hard to find anyone as late in
the season as this. Well, I guess it’s no affair of
mine. Glad it isn’t. How’s Eli running?”</p>

<p>“Like a clock,” replied Dick warmly. “He’s a
fine little car. I’d take you home, Tom, but
I’ve got Gordon with me. He went in the post
office.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, that’s all right. I’d like a ride sometime,
though, Dick. I’ve never been in one of those
things.”</p>

<p>“Well, I never had until a couple of weeks ago,”
laughed Dick. “I’ll get you to-morrow and take you
out to the field if you like, Tom.”</p>

<p>“Will you? You bet I’d like it! Much obliged.
It’ll be out of your way, though. You know I live
over by the railroad.”</p>

<p>“I know, but Eli doesn’t mind the cars!”</p>

<p>Tom smiled as he nodded and went on, and Gordon
hurried out of the post office. “Sorry to keep
you waiting,” he said as he jumped back into the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
car. “There was a mob at the stamp window,
though.”</p>

<p>“What was it you wanted to see me about?” asked
Dick as he turned the car cautiously about and narrowly
escaped a corner of a coal-wagon.</p>

<p>“About Mr. Grayson,” replied Gordon, relaxing
his clutch on the side of the car as the danger was
averted.</p>

<p>“What has he been doing, Gordie?”</p>

<p>“It’s what he’s going to do. He’s going to have
a birthday next month.”</p>

<p>“Think of that!” marveled Dick. “I didn’t suppose
high school principals ever paid attention to
anything so—so frivolous as birthdays!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that he does,” laughed the other,
“but some of the girls are. Hasn’t Louise Brent
said anything to you about it?”</p>

<p>“No. I haven’t seen her for a couple of days.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t! What’s the matter? Haven’t
quarreled, I hope.” Gordon’s tone was vastly concerned.</p>

<p>“No, but I’ve been busy. Stop your kidding and
tell me what you are trying to get at.”</p>

<p>“Well, the girls—quite a lot of them, mostly
seniors, I think—want to give Mr. Grayson a present<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
of some sort on his birthday. You know he’s pretty
popular with the ladies, Dick.”</p>

<p>“What’s it going to be? A sofa-pillow?”</p>

<p>“No, you idiot! What the girls want to do is get
up a purse, collect a lot of money, you know, and
refurnish his office for him.”</p>

<p>Dick whistled. “That <em>would</em> be a lot of money!
He certainly needs new furniture, though. But the
question is whether Mr. Grayson is popular enough
with the fellows, Gordie.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s not a bad old scout, Dick. Of course,
he’s always been rather down on athletics——”</p>

<p>“Hold on now! Let’s be fair. He hasn’t been
down on athletics, Gordie. He merely thinks that
we fellows pay too much attention to it. He’s not—not
awfully sympathetic, but it isn’t fair to say that
he’s against it. Now go on, and pardon the slight
digression.”</p>

<p>“All right; he’s not what I said. Anyhow, I
think most fellows like Grayson pretty well. They
ought to. He’s awfully fair and—and decent, even
when he gives you fits about something.”</p>

<p>“I trust he has never had occasion to give you
fits,” said Dick gravely.</p>

<p>Gordon grinned. “Well, we’ve had one or two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
slight misunderstandings,” he replied cheerfully.
“But I don’t hold it against him.”</p>

<p>“That’s sweet of you. I hope you’ve told him so.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dry up and listen. And don’t wobble the
car about so! It gives me heart-failure. That’s
what Morris did the day we went through the
fence.”</p>

<p>“Your conversation is so absorbing that it quite
takes my mind from the car,” replied Dick. “Perhaps
you’d better wait until I get you home.”</p>

<p>“All right, seeing that I’m most there—if nothing
happens. There’s Fudge on the porch.” Gordon
waved and Fudge shouted something unintelligible
and Eli chugged around the corner of Troutman
Street and drew up at the Merricks’ gate. “Come
on in a minute,” said Gordon.</p>

<p>“No, you sit right here and unfold your tale.
I’ll put the brake on hard so Eli won’t run away.
There! Now what’s the scheme and what must I do
about it?”</p>

<p>“Well, they wanted me to talk to you about it
first; the girls, I mean. They seemed to think you
had a certain amount of sense. I don’t know why
they thought so, but——”</p>

<p>“Never mind the compliments, Gordie. You tell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
them that I am with them heart and soul and think
it’s a fine idea. Now, what is it?”</p>

<p>“Well, they want to do the thing quietly, you see;
keep it a secret.”</p>

<p>“I don’t just see how they can,” Dick objected,
“if they mean to raise money by subscription.”</p>

<p>“Keep it a secret from Mr. Grayson, I mean, you
idiot! They want to get the things and then smuggle
them into the office when he’s out.”</p>

<p>“They’ll have trouble keeping it dark, I’m afraid,”
said Dick seriously. “Someone’s almost certain to
let it out.”</p>

<p>Gordon nodded. “That’s what I said, but your
sister——”</p>

<p>“Is she one of the conspirators?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“Yes. She said she was certain none of the girls
would tell and so it would be up to the fellows.
And of course I had to stand up for my sex, Dick,
and tell her that none of us would let it out.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why I haven’t heard something about
all this,” mused Dick.</p>

<p>“You have—now. The girls were keeping it quiet
until this morning. Nell Sawin called me up on the
telephone after breakfast and told me and said I was
to speak to you about it and make you come to-night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>“Come where to-night? Your talk is wonderfully
lucid, Gordie.”</p>

<p>“To Louise’s house,” laughed Gordon. “There’s
to be a sort of meeting of the—the——”</p>

<p>“Criminals,” prompted Dick.</p>

<p>“Ways and means committee, or something. Just
a few of the girls and you and Morris, naturally,
and Lanny and me. Will you come?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course. Hold on, though! To-night?
I don’t believe I can, to-night, Gordie. You see
school opens to-morrow and I haven’t really done a
thing yet.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. No one has. Anyhow, it won’t
take long and you can go home afterwards and
study as much as you like. They especially want
you there, Dick. In fact, I don’t dare to show up
without you!”</p>

<p>“Well, if that’s so I’ll go,” laughed Dick. “Joking
aside, though, I like the scheme. Mr. Grayson
is a fine man, Gordie, even if he does happen to be a
principal, and it will be a mighty nice thing to show
him we think so. I don’t believe the school has
ever done anything like this for him since he came
here. If it has I’ve never heard of it.”</p>

<p>“Nor I. How long has he been here, I wonder?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p>“Must be fourteen or fifteen years. He came as
assistant to old Mr. Flagg, who’s superintendent
of education now. I suppose Mr. Grayson can’t
be much over fifty, Gordie, but I’m so used to
thinking him an old man that it seems as if he was
somewhere about seventy.”</p>

<p>“I suppose he really isn’t so dreadfully old,”
said the other. “I dare say most of the fellows
will be glad to chip in and get him a present.”</p>

<p>“How much money will it take?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I suppose the idea is to get as
much as we can and buy accordingly. If every
student gave a dollar——”</p>

<p>“Some of them won’t give a quarter,” replied
Dick. “Lots of them can’t afford to.”</p>

<p>“Well, if only half of them gave a dollar
apiece——”</p>

<p>“Don’t count your chickens before they’re
hatched, Gordie. And pile out now; I’ve got to get
home to supper. What time does this conference
take place? Do I have to ‘doll up’ for it?”</p>

<p>“Of course not. They didn’t say what time.
About half-past seven, I suppose. Ask Grace.”</p>

<p>“I might do that,” agreed Dick, as Gordon vacated
his seat. “See you later then. Get up, Eli!”</p>

<small>A DISCOURAGED CAPTAIN</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The Brents lived in a fine, large house two
blocks beyond Gordon. Mr. John Brent was
Clearfield’s richest and most influential citizen,
and “Brentwood,” as his estate was called, was
quite the most luxurious in town. The house stood
back from the street in a full block of land, and to-night,
as Dick and his sister Grace, a pretty, dark-haired
girl of thirteen, approached it from the gate,
lights shone from many windows and it looked most
imposing. As the evening was mild, Louise Brent,
hostess for the occasion, assembled her guests on
the big screened porch at the side of the house
which was much more like a room than a veranda.
There were gaily-colored rugs on the floor, many
comfortable wicker chairs, a table that held a broad-shaded
electric lamp, and plants in tubs and boxes.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
When all had gathered the chairs were filled and
Morris Brent, Louise’s brother, removed a plant
from a willow stool and took its place, trying, as
Gordon said, to look like a begonia!</p>

<p>Morris was a handsome, finely built boy of sixteen.
He was sometimes accused of snobbishness,
but in justice to him it should be said that his snobbishness
was more apparent than real. Being the
only son of John Brent had always made it a little
difficult for Morris to win acceptance amongst the
fellows on his own merits. Louise resembled
Morris but little. While, like him, she was tall, unlike
him she had a very fair skin, hair that was
more nearly yellow than brown, and blue eyes. Her
prettiness was due more to her expression of sweetness
and animation than to her features. She was
a year younger than Morris.</p>

<p>The other girls of the party were Grace Lovering,
Nell Sawin and May Burnham. Nell was sixteen,
a round, good-natured girl whom everybody liked,
and May Burnham was fourteen, slim, dark and
quiet. She was a cousin of Louise’s.</p>

<p>Lansing White completed the quartette of boys.
Lanny was sixteen, having reached that mature age
within the past fortnight, a lean, capable-looking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
youth with flaxen hair and eyes so darkly brown
that at first glance they seemed black, an illusion
probably due to the contrast with the very light
hair. He was perhaps the most popular boy in high
school, and his popularity was not entirely due to
his athletic prowess. He had the fine faculty of
making friends instantly and keeping them afterwards.
There wasn’t a kinder-hearted or more
thoughtful fellow in town than Lanny White, and
if he had an enemy no one knew it. Lanny was
captain of the eleven, caught on the nine and was
a sprinter of no mean ability.</p>

<p>It was May Burnham who explained the project,
since it was she who had originated it, and afterwards
they all discussed it. Mr. Grayson’s birthday
fell on the twenty-fifth of October, and, as
Morris pointed out, they had only some five weeks
in which to prepare for it. Louise read from a
list the articles necessary to a thorough refurnishing
of the Principal’s office at the High School. There
must be a new rug, a flat-topped desk, a swivel-chair,
an easy-chair, a straight-backed chair, a revolving
book-case and a filing-cabinet; although,
as Louise explained, the latter wasn’t so important
since the one now in use was in good condition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<p>“Only,” she said, “we thought the other furniture
ought to be mahogany, and the filing-cabinet there
now is oak and it would look sort of funny, I suppose,
with the other things.”</p>

<p>“How much would all that cost?” asked Lanny
anxiously.</p>

<p>“We don’t know exactly. We can get the furniture
from a New York store where papa buys things
and they will give it to us at a discount.”</p>

<p>“How much of a discount?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“Thirty per cent.,” replied Morris. “That would
make quite a difference. Read the prices we figured,
Louise.”</p>

<p>“Rug, sixteen dollars,” announced his sister, referring
again to the paper; “desk, forty-five; revolving
book-case, twelve; swivel-chair, twelve;
easy-chair, twenty; straight chair, five; filing-cabinet,
eighteen. Total, one hundred and twenty-eight.”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s silence. Then Gordon
whistled expressively. Dick shook his head.</p>

<p>“That’s a lot of money to have to get in four
weeks,” he said.</p>

<p>“Five,” said Morris.</p>

<p>“Well, five, if you like, Morris, but we’d probably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
have to pay for the things before we got them and
it would take a week to get them here, I guess.”</p>

<p>“There are nearly three hundred students in
school,” said Grace Lovering, “and if each only
gave fifty cents we’d have a hundred and fifty.”</p>

<p>“I know, but some won’t give anything—a few
won’t, that is—and some will give nearer a quarter
than a half.”</p>

<p>“And a lot will give a dollar,” protested Nell
Sawin. “I’m going to give two dollars, and so is
May, and Louise says she will give five!”</p>

<p>“Let’s start the list now,” said Louise. “Get
some paper, Morris, and a pen, won’t you? I think
either Dick or Lanny ought to head it.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I can’t give more than a dollar,” said
Dick. “So perhaps someone else had better start it.”</p>

<p>“You do it, Louise,” suggested Gordon. “Five
dollars will look pretty good at the top of it.”</p>

<p>“I thought of that,” said Louise, “but we were
afraid it would look as if we expected everyone to
give as much. And of course we don’t want anyone
to give more than he feels he can afford.”</p>

<p>“It’s up to Lanny, then,” said Morris, returning
with paper and pen. “Who’s going to write this,
and what do you want to say?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p>“You do it,” replied his sister. “Just write ‘The
undersigned agree to subscribe the amounts set
against their names for the purpose—the purpose——’”</p>

<p>“For the Twenty-fifth of October Fund,” suggested
Dick. “Better not put it down on paper.
And I’d add that the subscriber hereby promises to
keep still about it.”</p>

<p>“Good idea,” commended Morris, writing under
the lamp. “How’s this, then? ‘Subscription List.
The undersigned agree to subscribe to the fund
known as the Twenty-fifth of October Fund the
sums set down against their names, and hereby
promise not to divulge the purpose of said
fund.’”</p>

<p>“A good many ‘funds’ in it,” objected Lanny.</p>

<p>“Let’s hope so,” replied May, with a laugh.
“Don’t be critical. I think it’s lovely, Morris.”</p>

<p>“All right. Here’s the pen, Lanny. Put your
‘John Hancock’ on the first line.”</p>

<p>“Your slang pains me, Morris,” murmured
Lanny. “It’s only going to be two dollars, folks.”</p>

<p>“<em>Only</em> two dollars!” said Gordon. “Gee, that’s
a lot! Who’s next? You are, Dick.”</p>

<p>Dick signed and the list went to Louise and then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
to Morris, the latter duplicating his sister’s subscription.</p>

<p>“Seems to me,” said Morris, as he handed the pen
to May Burnham, “May should have headed it.
She started the trouble.”</p>

<p>“Of course!” agreed Louise. “Perhaps there’s
room above Lanny’s name. Is there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I’d rather not,” replied May. “I’ll
write here, and”—she looked around almost defiantly—“I
believe I’ll say three instead of two!”</p>

<p>“Then I will!” exclaimed Nell. “We don’t have
to pay for four weeks, do we?”</p>

<p>“We’d ought to pay when we sign, I think,” said
Dick, “but I can’t, and so I don’t insist.”</p>

<p>“Neither can I,” said Lanny. “Who’s next?
Has Gordon signed? Be a sport, Gordie, and put
down a hundred!”</p>

<p>“I’m doing it,” answered Gordon, “only I’m putting
a dot where it will do the most good.”</p>

<p>When the list was finally returned to Louise that
young lady exclaimed delightedly, “Why, we’ve
got twenty-one dollars already! Isn’t that fine?”</p>

<p>“Enough to get the easy-chair!” said Nell.
“Why, at this rate it won’t take us any time to get
it all!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p>“Maybe the others won’t be enthusiastic,
though,” replied Gordon. “By the way, were those
prices you gave the prices we’ll have to pay for the
things, Louise?”</p>

<p>“Why, no! We forgot that! We won’t have to
pay nearly so much, will we? Thirty per cent. of
one hundred and twenty-eight is—is——”</p>

<p>“Thirty-seven-forty,” said Morris.</p>

<p>“Thirty-eight dollars and forty cents,” corrected
May. “Then we will have to pay only about—about
ninety dollars! That’s lovely!”</p>

<p>“Say a hundred, to be on the safe side,” advised
Dick. “I guess we can manage that. The question
is now, how are we going at it? Wouldn’t it be
well to have several lists and——”</p>

<p>“Have four,” said Lanny. “You take one and
Gordon will take one——”</p>

<p>“Thank you!” muttered Gordon.</p>

<p>“And Louise and Nell can have the other two.”</p>

<p>And so it was arranged, in spite of Gordon’s
lack of enthusiasm, and that necessitated the making
of four new lists with two signatures on each.</p>

<p>“I want to see you destroy that first subscription
of mine,” announced Lanny. “If I had to pay two
dollars twice I’d be broke all the Fall!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>“Observe, then,” replied Morris. “Across and
across! There! Now let’s have those eats, Sis.”</p>

<p>While they devoured the sandwiches and cake
and lemonade that Louise brought in a minute later
they elected that young lady Treasurer of the Fund,
appointed her and Morris and May a Committee on
Purchase and finally broke up, Dick declaring that
since school began in the morning he believed it
would be a good idea to glance at one or two books.
After saying good night to the others, he and Grace
took their departure, followed a few minutes later
by Lanny, Gordon, May and Nell. Having escorted
the girls to their homes, Lanny and Gordon
walked back together to B Street. Quite naturally,
their conversation had to do with football affairs,
and Lanny confessed that he was getting pretty
discouraged.</p>

<p>“Mr. Grayson says we ought to get along without
a coach and use what money we’d pay one to repair
the grandstand and the fence. There isn’t a bit
of good spending money on that grandstand, Gordon.
We need a new one. And I just wish Grayson
had my job awhile! He’d find out what a lot
of fun it is to turn out a football team without a
coach. I put my name down for two dollars for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
a present to him, but I think I’d a heap rather kick
him in the shins sometimes!”</p>

<p>Lanny’s laugh, however, threw doubt on his
assertion.</p>

<p>“We play Highland Hall Saturday, don’t we?”
asked Gordon.</p>

<p>“Yes. Highland doesn’t trouble me any, though.
We could beat her with the Scrubs. But Locust
Valley comes the Saturday after, and those fellows
have a mighty good team as a usual thing. I don’t
suppose it would hurt us to get beaten. Might be
a good thing. Still, if you’re captain you sort of
like to have a clean slate, if you can.”</p>

<p>“Have you heard from the man at Westport?
Cotner said you were after someone there.”</p>

<p>“Not yet. I don’t even know that he’s still there.
I don’t suppose he will want to come, anyhow. We
can’t pay enough to make it worth his while. It’s
a shame we can’t have a graduate coaching system,
as Springdale has. She doesn’t seem to have much
trouble getting coaches. That chap Newman who
has been coaching her for three or four years is a
dandy. I’ll bet she’ll beat us again this year; maybe
worse than she did last!”</p>

<p>“Don’t you believe it, Lanny! Cheer up and hear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
the birdies sing! Things will turn out all right in
a few days. You see if they don’t.”</p>

<p>“Hope so, I’m sure. I’m willing to do my level
best, but I can’t be captain and coach and everything
else. We’ve got a poor lot of new men this
Fall, too. And then there’s Morris’s leg to worry
about. The doctor says he can play and Morris says
his leg’s all right, but if we go to work and build up
the team around his kicking and then he has another
injury to it or his father says he can’t play we’ll
be in a nice fix! We’ve got to develop a couple
of punters somehow, but I’m sure I don’t know
where to look for them. Wayland isn’t so poor, but
he doesn’t seem to get the hang of it. Well, good
night, Gordon. Sorry I’ve bothered you.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” laughed the other. “It will
do you good to get it off your chest. You’ll find,
though, that the fellows will all work harder,
Lanny, if they’ve got it to do. And—and I’ll tell
you what I’ll do.”</p>

<p>“Spring it!”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you the sodas at Castle’s that we have a
coach within a week.”</p>

<p>“Take you! I’d buy Castle’s whole soda fountain
if I could get a coach that way. Good night!”</p>

<small>LOUISE HAS AN IDEA</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Clearfield played Highland Hall Military
Academy four days later and it is safe to say
that practically the entire juvenile population
of the town turned out to see the first football
game of the season. Perhaps the weather had something
to do with the size of the audience that filled
the grandstand and overflowed on the field, for
there was a zest and a snap to the air that hinted
overcoats, and the sun played hide-and-seek behind
the scudding gray clouds. Brent Field, as the High
School athletic grounds are called, is only a scant
block and a half from the river and when the wind
is from the northwest, as it was this afternoon,
the few scattered buildings between field and river
afford but little protection.</p>

<p>Highland Hall had brought along most of its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
Fourth Year Class—the Academy regulations forbade
members of other classes accompanying the
teams away from school—and the forty-odd boys
looked very fine and manly in their cadet-blue cape-coats,
below which tan-gaitered legs twinkled. They
assembled at one end of the stand and gave their
team a lusty welcome when it trotted on the gridiron,
waving their blue-and-blue banners proudly.
The dark blue and light blue of the flags was repeated
in the costumes of the players, and their
sweaters held the letters H. H. M. A. cunningly
arranged, the first H taking the form of a football
goal and the other letters appearing in the space
under the cross-bar. But, in spite of the neat attire
of players and supporters, Highland Hall was no
dangerous adversary. The fellows, as Fudge explained
to Gordon, were allowed only two hours a
day for recreation and were coached by the Commandant,
a grave martinet of a man who knew more
of military tactics than football. Fudge and Gordon
were seated on the bench, after a ten-minute workout,
and Fudge, who had more flesh than he needed,
was still breathing hard from his exertions.</p>

<p>“That’s the coach over there,” he said, nodding
across the gridiron. “He’s a terror, they say.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p>“You have a cousin at Highland, haven’t you?”
asked Gordon. “Is he here to-day?”</p>

<p>“No, he’s only in the Second Year Class, and they
don’t let any but the Fourth Year fellows go away
from school. They’re strict as anything. I’m glad
they didn’t send me there. Dad wanted to, but ma
and I were dead against it.” Fudge grinned reminiscently.
“I told ma I didn’t think I was strong
enough for it.”</p>

<p>“Fudge, you’re a fakir,” said Gordon cheerfully.
Fudge was starting to deny this indignantly when
Lanny White, returning from the center of the field
where he had won the toss-up, summoned the players.</p>

<p>“All right, fellows,” said Lanny. “They kick-off
and we take the west goal. Get into it, now, and
let’s get the drop on them!”</p>

<p>“Now let’s see who’s who,” murmured Gordon
as the team trotted out and spread over the west
end of the field. “Haley, center; Cable and Kent,
guards; Horsford and— Hello, Will Scott’s playing
right tackle! What’s the matter with Wayland?”</p>

<p>“Sick; has tonsilitis or something. Who’s that
going to play left end, Gordie?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p>“Jim Grover; and Toll is right end, Cottrell,
quarter, Lanny and Rob Hansard, halves, and Felker,
fullback. I guess that’s about the way we’ll line
up in the Springdale game, barring accidents; only,
of course, Way will get in, and Morris Brent.”
Gordon leaned forward and spoke along the bench.
“Aren’t you going to play, Morris?”</p>

<p>Morris shrugged the shoulders under the purple
sweater he wore. “I don’t know,” he answered.
“Maybe in the last quarter.”</p>

<p>Gordon nodded. “Hope so,” he said. And then,
to Fudge: “Lanny’s not taking any chances with
Morris, is he? There’s the whistle!”</p>

<p>Lanny got the kick-off and, unaided by interference,
raced back nearly twenty yards before he was
stopped. Clearfield set to work with the few plays
she had ready, simple attacks from a tandem formation
in which the runner relied more on speed
and force than deception. Two first downs were
gained and then a fumble necessitated a punt, and
Felker, who was called on, booted the ball almost
straight into the air and Clearfield not only lost
possession of the pigskin but some eight yards besides.</p>

<p>Highland started in with a will. She used a wide<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
open formation and on the first play attempted a
double pass which, had it succeeded, would have
netted much territory. But, perhaps more by good
luck than good management, Jack Toll nailed the
runner near the side line for a scant two-yard gain.
A second attempt, a forward pass straight over the
middle of the line, went better and Highland made
her distance easily. An involved play in which quarter
faked a kick and then passed to a halfback for
a run around the short side, only resulted in the ball
being taken in about where it had gone into play.
A plunge at tackle on the left gained three yards
and, with six to go on third down, Highland punted.
The ball was well handled and well kicked and Cottrell
got it behind his goal and touched it back.
On her twenty yards Clearfield started her advance
once more and carried almost to midfield before she
was again forced to punt.</p>

<p>This time Felker did better, although the ball
covered but a scant twenty-five yards. Highland,
failing to gain at center, returned the kick and the
ball was Clearfield’s on her forty-five yards. Rob
Hansard got away around right end for a first down
and on the next play repeated the performance for
four more. Lanny made the distance off left<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
tackle. The Blue-and-Blue was proving weak at her
wings and Lanny wisely continued the assault at
those positions. Both he and Hansard got around
without much difficulty until the ball was on the
opponent’s twenty-yard line. Then Lanny was nailed
for a five-yard loss, and Cottrell, faking a forward
pass, tossed the ball to Felker and that youth
banged his way straight through the middle of the
enemy’s line for twelve yards. From there, in three
plays, Clearfield took the ball over, Hansard securing
the touchdown. Cable missed the try-at-goal.</p>

<p>The first quarter ended after the kick-off, the
score 6 to 0.</p>

<p>The second period saw one more score for the
home team. Highland fumbled on her forty yards
and Cottrell picked up the ball and tore off fifteen
yards before he was stopped. A fake forward pass
with the ball going to Lanny failed to gain, but
Felker smashed through for four and Hansard
barely gained first down by sliding off right tackle.
Felker fumbled but Lanny recovered for a two-yard
loss and then skirted the opponent’s left end for a
touchdown in the corner of the field. The punt-out
placed the ball directly in front of goal and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
just back of the fifteen-yard line, and this time Bert
Cable had no difficulty in negotiating the extra
point. For the rest of the period Clearfield played
on the defensive and kicked frequently, and the
half ended with the ball in Highland Hall’s possession
on her own forty-three yards.</p>

<p>Dick watched the game from the grandstand in
company with Louise Brent, who, like most of the
High School girls, was an ardent football lover.
Between the halves, however, Louise abandoned the
game long enough to announce the progress of the
Fund.</p>

<p>“It was forty-three dollars and sixty cents this
noon, Dick,” she said. “That isn’t bad, but I
thought we’d have lots more by this time. The
girls have done heaps better than the boys. They’ve
given almost two-thirds of the total. Do you think
the boys really dislike Mr. Grayson; many of them,
I mean?”</p>

<p>“No, but most of the younger fellows don’t have
much spending money, Louise, and I suppose they
think they need sodas and candy and such things
more than Mr. Grayson needs a new desk!” Dick
smiled at his companion’s expression of disapproval.
“They’ll fall into line in the end, though, I guess.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
Gordon told me last night that most of the fellows
he has been after have only given twenty-five or
fifty cents.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve done beautifully,” said Louise.</p>

<p>“I’ve bullied the chaps,” laughed Dick. “Anyway,
it’s easier to get money from the seniors.
They’ve got more, in the first place, and then they’re
more willing to give it up. Some of the younger
boys have it in for Mr. Grayson for one reason or
another, I suppose. We’ll get the full amount finally,
I think. It would be a lot easier if we didn’t
have to be so secret about it. We could call a meeting
some day at recess and pretty nearly get the
whole amount, I’ll bet. But it would surely get
around if we did that and Mr. Grayson would hear
of it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and half the fun will be in surprising him,”
said Louise. “We’re going to take Miss Turner into
the secret and she will let us into Mr. Grayson’s
office the night before his birthday. Won’t it be
exciting?”</p>

<p>“Terribly,” agreed Dick. “Imagine us tiptoeing
in there in the dark, you carrying the desk and May
the revolving book-case and Nell the—the arm-chair——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p>“No, don’t let her take the arm-chair,” begged
Louise. “She’ll be sure to set it down and go to
sleep in it. What are you going to carry?”</p>

<p>“I thought I’d take the small chair,” replied Dick
gravely. “I’m very unselfish, you see. I leave the
larger honors to the rest of you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, larger and heavier,” laughed the girl.
“There they come again! Do you know, I sort of
half wish Highland Hall would score, Dick?
They’re such nice-looking boys, and their uniforms
are so stunning!”</p>

<p>“They’ve certainly got us beaten on appearance,”
said Dick. “Hello, Lanny’s sending the same fellows
back.”</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t he?”</p>

<p>“There’s no law against it, only, with a lead of
thirteen points, it seems to me it would be a good
chance to let some of the subs smell gunpowder.
I guess he knows what he’s doing, though.”</p>

<p>“I do hope he has a successful season,” said
Louise. “I like Lanny, and he always works so
hard at everything that he deserves to win.”</p>

<p>“He’s pretty well handicapped just now. The
team really does need a coach, and the Athletic Committee
didn’t make any kind of a popular hit with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
the school when it decided against paying for one
the other night. The fellows blame Mr. Grayson
for that, by the way, and I suppose that’s one reason
why they don’t subscribe more liberally to the Fund.
There’s a wretched kick-off for you!”</p>

<p>“Did Bert Cable do that, Dick? I thought he
usually kicked splendidly.”</p>

<p>“He does the best he can considering that he
doesn’t think it worth while to cock the ball any,”
replied Dick dryly. “Bert evidently thinks that pile
of sand out there is to look at. If he’d tee the ball
up properly and— Good work, Clearfield!”</p>

<p>Kent, the purple-legged right guard had broken
through and smeared Highland’s play behind her
line, and an approving cheer arose from the stand.
Highland tried an end run and made four yards
and then attempted a forward pass which failed.
With almost ten yards to go, she got a fine long punt
away and her ends raced up the field under it and,
undisturbed by the wretched attempt at interference
put up by the Clearfield backs, nailed Cottrell in his
tracks. For six of the ten minutes constituting the
third period Highland, playing desperately, held
her opponent away from her goal line. Then a
fumble by Lanny worked to Clearfield’s advantage,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
for Chester Cottrell recovered the ball as it trickled
back, dodged a plunging Highland forward, put an
end out with a straight-arm and suddenly found
himself clear. That run began on Clearfield’s
thirty-seven yards and would certainly have resulted
in a touchdown had not Cottrell, in evading a tackle
by the opposing quarter, slipped one foot across the
side line. Although Cottrell kept on and landed
the ball under the cross-bar, and although Clearfield
expressed its delight with much shouting, the referee
called the ball back and put it in play on Highland’s
twenty-three yards. The Blue-and-Blue won
the admiration of friend and foe alike then, for
she disputed every inch of the ground and Clearfield
won her first down only after the hardest
work and by a margin so slim that the linesmen
had to trot in with the chain and measure the distance.
Lanny’s attempt on the next play to circle
the opponent’s left wing failed and Felker could
make only three yards through the line. With
seven to go on the third down, Lanny and Cottrell
put their heads together and Lanny called in Morris
Brent.</p>

<p>The ball was then almost opposite the center of
the goal and on the ten-yard line. Morris dropped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
back to kicking position, swung one sturdy leg experimentally
and held up his hands. Highland,
shouting, “<em>Block it! Block it!</em>”, poised, ready to
break through. Then back shot the ball. Morris
barely caught it as it tried to pass over his head.
Before he could get back into position the Blue-and-Blue
was on him. Wisely, he made no effort to
kick, for the ball would surely have been blocked,
but instead ran back and desperately attempted a
forward pass to Grover. The ball, however,
grounded and there was a minute of time during
which Highland tried to persuade the referee that
the pass was illegal, that Morris had purposely
grounded the ball to save a loss of territory. But
the official decided that the play had been fair and
the teams lined up on the twenty-one yards and
again Morris walked back. The chance of scoring
by drop-kick was pretty slim now, for the kicker
was near the thirty-yard line and Highland had
just demonstrated her ability to break through.
But Morris did it. The pass was straight and
breast-high and the ball left his toe quickly and surmounted
the upstretched hands of the leaping enemy.
There was an instant of doubt as the pigskin
seemed to hesitate at the bar, but it went over,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
although by inches only, and Clearfield’s thirteen
points became sixteen.</p>

<p>As the teams lined up again for the kick-off
Morris retired once more, receiving an ovation as he
walked to the bench. Nelson Beaton took his place
for the few seconds remaining. Then the whistle
blew and the third period was at an end.</p>

<p>When the teams faced each other again on Clearfield’s
thirty yards substitutes were much in evidence.
Jones was in place of Grover, Arthur Beaton
for Haley, Tupper for Hansard and Kirke for Cottrell,
and Felker was back at full. Highland Hall,
too, had run new men on. Clearfield started rushing
again and was soon past the center of the field.
Kirke, the substitute quarter, got his signals mixed
then and there was a ten-yard loss, and Clearfield
kicked. Highland caught the ball on her twenty-five-yard
line and came back twelve, the Purple’s
ends showing up poorly. In the next scrimmage
Beaton, Clearfield’s substitute center, received a
blow on the head and retired in favor of Pete
Robey. Pete had been trying for guard position
and the duties of center rush were none too familiar
to him, and, in spite of Lanny’s coaching, he was
very weak on defense. Twice Highland made big<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
gains through him before the secondary defense
came to his assistance. Near the middle of the
field Highland was forced to punt and Tupper fumbled
on his twelve yards, recovered, tried to advance
by a run across the field and was finally stopped for
no gain. A fake-kick play with Felker taking the
ball for a try around left end resulted in a loss and
Felker kicked on second down. Highland signaled
fair-catch and held the ball on Clearfield’s thirty-seven
yards. A forward pass went diagonally to
the right end and that youth plunged through half
the Clearfield team before he was forced out near
the twenty-yard line. The blue-coated adherents of
the visiting team cheered lustily and implored a
touchdown.</p>

<p>A wide end run gained a scant three yards and
took the ball well over to the Clearfield side of the
gridiron. Another forward pass was tried but was
incompleted, and, with seven to go on third down,
the Highland right tackle fell out of the line and
walked back to about the thirty yards, while the
quarterback knelt in front of him and patted the
turf.</p>

<p>“I hope he makes a goal,” declared Louise Brent,
in the grandstand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<p>“He won’t this time,” answered Dick, as Highland
arranged her men to protect the kicker. Louise
looked a question. “Highland has two downs yet,”
he continued, “and that angle is almost impossible
for anyone but a Brickley. They’ve made our fellows
spread out and open their line and they’ll either
snap the ball to that fellow who pretends he is going
to place-kick and he will try a forward or the ball
will go to one of those backs for a run straight
through the middle. At least, that’s the way I size
it up. We’ll see now.”</p>

<p>As Dick ended the ball shot back from center
into the hands of the second back from the line and
that youth put down his head and sprang straight
ahead and went through for all of five yards before
the secondary defense stopped him. Once more
Highland Hall cheered loudly, and, almost before
they had ceased, the Blue-and-Blue had added another
three yards by an attack on right tackle and
had gained her first down and shifted the ball a
good twelve feet nearer the center of the field.
The play was just inside the home team’s ten-yard
line now and Clearfield supporters were hoarsely
commanding the defenders of the east goal to
“Hold ’em!” The time-keeper trotted on to announce<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
two minutes left as the Highland quarterback
piped his signals again. A half was sent hurtling
against the left of Clearfield’s line for a scant
yard, and a plunge at center, with quarterback
carrying the ball, netted but two more. Again the
tackle stepped back, this time apparently for a drop-kick,
since the quarter did not accompany him, and
again the defenders spread their line. The angle to
the goal was by no means impossible now and the
watchers held their breaths as the teams crouched.</p>

<p>“Block this!” implored Lanny. “Block this
kick!”</p>

<p>“Watch for a fake!” counseled Kirke shrilly from
between his goal-posts. Then came the signals, a
halfback moved slightly forward, the ball shot back
to the outstretched hands of the waiting tackle and
the teams sprang together. The tackle’s long leg
swung, and a few of the opponents who were cut
off from sight of the ball, leaped into the air, but
there was no thud of ball against shoe, for the tackle
stepped nimbly to the right, poised the pigskin and
hurled it straight and hard across the battling lines
to where an undetected back had stolen around and
behind the goal line. Though frenzied hands strove
to intercept the ball, it settled into the catcher’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
hands and stayed there while he was hurled to the
ground two yards back of goal.</p>

<p>Perhaps the blue flags weren’t waved then as the
cape-coated squad sprang to their feet and hurled
joyous shrieks to the sky! And perhaps that crafty
back wasn’t thumped and hugged when he was at
last pulled to his feet! For Highland had done
what she had never done before in ten years of
Clearfield contests; she had crossed the Purple’s
goal-line!</p>

<p>Disgustedly, Clearfield lined up under her goal as
the ball was taken out for the try, and still more
disgustedly she saw it pass a minute later straight
over the bar, while Highland Hall shouted and
waved riotously. Over at the score-board the small
sophomore who officiated there smeared out the figure
6 after “Highland Hall” and, protest in every
movement, chalked up a big white 7.</p>

<p>Clearfield tried to take revenge in the remaining
sixty-odd seconds and fought desperately, but the
time was too short and the last whistle blew with
the ball in Highland’s possession near her thirty
yards.</p>

<p>“I’m glad they scored,” said Louise a trifle defiantly
as Dick put his crutches under his arms preparatory<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
to descending the stand. “They deserved
to, didn’t they?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Dick agreed doubtfully. Then he repeated
the word ungrudgingly. “Yes, they did deserve
to, Louise. Any team deserves to win who is smart
enough to take advantage of its opponents’ mistakes.
And that is what Highland Hall did.”</p>

<p>“That,” responded Louise, as they waited for the
aisle to clear, “sounds as if you thought the others
didn’t really earn that score, Dick.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean it to. Highland earned her touchdown,
all right. Profiting by the other fellow’s
mistakes is more than half the game.”</p>

<p>“But I thought our boys played a very good
game,” objected Louise loyally.</p>

<p>“Far be it from me to dispute you,” replied Dick,
with a smile.</p>

<p>“But didn’t they?” she insisted. “Of course,
Dick, I don’t know very much about such things,
but I want to learn. Didn’t they play well?”</p>

<p>“Clearfield,” answered Dick, “was at least twenty-four
points better than Highland Hall, Louise.
She won by the score of sixteen to seven. As Mr.
Grayson says, I invite your consideration.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Louise. “What was the matter, Dick?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span></p>

<p>“Well,” replied the other, as he stumped cautiously
down the steps, “it’s the general who watches the
battle through a pair of field glasses who sees best
what’s going on. Clearfield needed a general. It
was a good fight on Clearfield’s part, but there was
an unnecessary loss of lives!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you mean we needed a coach!”</p>

<p>“Badly,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“Then—then why don’t you do it?” exclaimed
Louise. “Dick! Why don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you mustn’t think that just because I can
criticize I could have managed that game any better,”
laughed Dick. “Almost anyone can be a critic,
but football coaches are a scarce article, Louise.”</p>

<p>“Just the same, I believe you could, Dick! And
I think it’s funny Lanny hasn’t thought of it!”</p>

<p>“I don’t,” Dick replied. “I’d think it funny if
he did, considering that I’ve never played it and have
to toddle around on a pair of sticks!”</p>

<p>“That has nothing to do with it,” replied Louise
convincedly. “I shall speak to him about it right
away. Isn’t it perfectly fine that I thought of it?”</p>

<small>DICK CONSENTS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Something very much in the nature of an
indignation meeting was held on the High
School steps on Monday at recess. There were
no prepared addresses, nor did parliamentary rules
govern the meeting, but free speech was in order and
liberally indulged in. Lanny was not present, but
the football element was well represented, and it
was Morris Brent, for once holding views coincident
with popular sentiment, who most heartily condemned
the Athletic Committee for their decision
regarding the employment of a salaried football
coach. Morris, munching an apple on the top step,
proclaimed indignantly that the Athletic Committee
of the Clearfield High School didn’t care a bone
button whether the team got beaten or not.</p>

<p>“What kind of a team do they think we can turn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
out without a coach?” he demanded, addressing the
throng in general but frowningly regarding Toby
Sears, Senior Class President. “Who’s going to
look after the physical condition of the fellows?
Why, along about the middle of the season we’ll
have a hospital list as long as my arm! The trouble
with that Committee is that they’re a lot of old
grannies!”</p>

<p>Sears shrugged his shoulders and replied a bit
resentfully: “Well, you needn’t blame me for it!
I’m not on the Committee. Tell it to Wayland and
Scott and those who are.”</p>

<p>“You can’t blame them for it, either,” said Pete
Farrar. “They were outvoted. Will Scott told me
so. Wayland couldn’t go to the meeting because he
was sick. And, anyhow, with only three undergraduates
against four grads and faculties, what can
you do?”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said someone else. “We ought to
be better represented. It would be fairer to have as
many undergrads as grads.”</p>

<p>“Don’t see as it makes much difference, anyhow,”
observed Sears. “Lanny White told me Saturday
that some man he was after had turned us down
and that he didn’t know where to look next. So,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
even if the Committee hadn’t decided against a
coach, it wouldn’t have made any difference. There
isn’t anyone to get.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve got to have someone,” insisted
Morris, aiming his apple-core at the rubbish barrel
and missing it badly, “even if he’s not much of a
coach. Lanny can’t run the First Team and the
Scrub and look after the new fellows too. No one
could. Besides, who ever heard of a football team
without a coach?”</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” said Pete Robey, “that there
ought to be some grad who could do it.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I say,” agreed Sears. “There must
be, too, if we’d look for him. Of course he might
not know a lot of football, but he’d be better than
nothing, I dare say.”</p>

<p>“It’s Grayson’s fault,” said Bingham, a tall, bespectacled
sophomore. And Bingham, as unpopular
a boy as there was in school, for once found
support.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet it is,” muttered another, between mouthfuls
of sandwich. “He’s always been down on
football.”</p>

<p>“And everything else we’ve ever tried to do,” supplemented
Bingham with a vindictive glare through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
his thick lenses. “And here we are asked to subscribe——”</p>

<p>“Shut up!” growled Pete Robey. “Can’t you
keep your silly mouth shut when you’re told to?”</p>

<p>Bingham subsided, muttering peevishly, and
George Cotner arrived at the foot of the steps just
as Morris began again: “I say what we ought to
do is stand up for our rights,” he declared with dignity.
“If we just told the Committee that we had
to have a football coach and meant to have one
they’d come off their high horse. After all, whose
money is it they’re so careful of? Isn’t it as much
ours as theirs?”</p>

<p>“Of course it is,” said Pete Farrar. “We earned
it!”</p>

<p>“How much did you earn?” asked Manager Cotner
sarcastically as he approached the storm center.</p>

<p>“Well, that doesn’t matter,” replied Farrar. “I
mean that we fellows earned the money at baseball
and football and things. And I dare say I earned
as much of it as you did, Cotner.”</p>

<p>“Which is none at all,” answered George calmly.
“You fellows are making a heap of noise about
nothing, if you only knew it.”</p>

<p>“How is that?” asked Sears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>“We’ve found a coach,” replied the manager
coolly.</p>

<p>Exclamations of surprise and curiosity came from
the gathering. “Who is he?” “Where’d we get
him?” “Who said so?” “Bet you’re fooling,
George!”</p>

<p>“Not at liberty to tell you just yet,” replied Cotner,
enjoying the sensation. “In fact, the matter is
not absolutely settled——”</p>

<p>“Thought so! Knew you were lying!”</p>

<p>“—But it will be this afternoon. Then you’ll
hear all about it.”</p>

<p>“Where’s he come from?” demanded Morris.</p>

<p>George hesitated, and then, “Right here,” he
answered.</p>

<p>“Clearfield? Do we know him?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Is he a graduate?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then it’s Mr. Cochran, of the Y.M.C.A.”</p>

<p>“Get out!” said Morris. “He wouldn’t leave a
job like the one he’s got to coach us.”</p>

<p>“He could do it without giving up his job,
couldn’t he? Isn’t it Cochran, George?”</p>

<p>“It is—not.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<p>“Then who——”</p>

<p>“I told you I couldn’t tell you, didn’t I? So don’t
ask. You’ll know this afternoon—or to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet he’s a frost, whoever he is,” Morris Brent
grumbled.</p>

<p>“Who found him? Lanny?”</p>

<p>“Er—no, not exactly.” George Cotner smiled.
“I don’t know who found him, exactly, although I
think I was the first one to suggest him. Oh, you’ll
be surprised all right, fellows!” He chuckled at
the bewildered expressions on the faces of the
others. “I’ll tell you one thing, though, just to
keep you interested; he’s never played a game of
football in his life!”</p>

<p>A howl of derision went up. “Now we know
you’re lying, George!” declared Sears.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s Mr. Grayson,” sneered Bingham, and
a laugh went up at that and the gathering broke up
in better humor as the gong summoned them back
to work.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the school at large did not
learn the identity of the new coach that afternoon,
for at nine o’clock that evening the candidate for
the honor was still holding off. He sat in the
little parlor of his home on E Street, a pair of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
crutches beside him, and listened doubtfully to the
insistence of Lanny White, George Cotner and Gordon
Merrick.</p>

<p>“There’s no use in your saying you can’t do it,
Dick,” declared Lanny, “because you can. We understand
that you don’t know football as well as
Joe Farrell does, and of course you’ve never played
it, but you do know a lot about it theoretically and
you’ve followed the game for years. What we want
is someone in authority, even if he doesn’t know
everything and can’t get into togs himself, and
you’re just the fellow, Dick. Every chap on the
team would be tickled to death to take orders from
you. Look at the way you had us crawling around
on our tummies last summer when you managed
the nine! Hang it, Dick, you’ve just got to do it!
There’s no one else, I tell you!”</p>

<p>“Lanny’s right,” said George earnestly. “What
we need is a fellow who can sort of sit up aloft,
as it were, and see how things are going and tell
us when we’re making mistakes. And we need to
get up a plan of battle, too, work out a campaign.
Why, as it is now, we’re just going along from
game to game and trusting to luck. Lanny can’t play
football and coach too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<p>“Be a good fellow, Dick,” urged Gordon.</p>

<p>“I won’t deny,” replied Dick, “that I’d like to try
it. As you say, I’ve never played the game, but I
have watched it and I do know the rules and I have
got theories. And—and maybe I could get the fellows
to do what I say. But—well, look here, now;
suppose I did take hold and my ideas of coaching a
team proved all wrong and we came an awful cropper
at the end of the season? After all, I’ve never
done it and it would be a risky sort of an experiment,
Lanny. My football may not be the sort
that succeeds, you see.”</p>

<p>“We’ll risk it, Dick. And we’ll promise that
whether we lick Springdale or get beaten we’ll never
make a whimper.”</p>

<p>“But what about the other fellows?” asked Dick,
with a smile.</p>

<p>“The other fellows?”</p>

<p>“Yes. They’d want to mob me.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! Why, look here, even Farrell can’t
turn out a winning team for us every year, Dick.
I’m not saying you’re the finest football coach in the
country, but, by George, you’re the only chap I know
of to-day I’d be satisfied to work under! Now
what do you say, Dick?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span></p>

<p>“And, look here, Dickums,” said Gordon, “you
want to remember that we can’t hire a coach if we
can find one. It’s up to you!”</p>

<p>“Where would I find time to study or do any
work?” asked Dick irresolutely. “If I went into
this I’d want to go in with both feet.”</p>

<p>“Of course you would!” responded George encouragingly.
“But a couple of hours in the afternoons
from now to the eighteenth of November
wouldn’t matter.”</p>

<p>“Do you think two hours a day was all that Joe
Farrell gave to football?” asked Dick grimly.</p>

<p>“Well——”</p>

<p>“Say, Lanny, who put this into your head?”</p>

<p>Lanny grinned sheepishly. “Louise Brent,” he
answered. “But she said she was surprised I hadn’t
thought of it myself, and, by Jove, Dick, so I am!”</p>

<p>“I thought of it a week ago, didn’t I, Dick?”
asked George eagerly. “Remember that first afternoon
of practice? I asked you then——”</p>

<p>“No post-mortems, George,” said Lanny. “That’s
settled then, eh, Dick?”</p>

<p>Dick smiled ruefully and gazed a moment at his
crutches. “How would I look,” he asked, “driving
a team on those things?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<p>“You’d look fine!” declared Lanny. “And you
could do it!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” laughed Gordon, “you could follow
the team in Eli!”</p>

<p>Dick smiled, and then asked: “There’s no money
in this, is there?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not,” replied Lanny. “The Committee——”</p>

<p>“That’s the way I’d want it. I wouldn’t dare
take any money for doing it, fellows. If I made
a mess of it I’d feel bad enough if I was doing it
for nothing, but if I was getting paid for it I’d
feel as if I’d cheated you. Now, one more thing,
Lanny. If I do—er—coach, it’s got to be understood
that I <em>am</em> coach.”</p>

<p>“You mean that——”</p>

<p>“That I’m in authority. That what I say goes.
It may sound cheeky, considering that I’m a greenhorn,
but it’s the only way for me to have any show
at making good.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Dick. You say the word and
you’re It from this moment. And if the way I
play doesn’t suit you you can put me on the bench
to-morrow. Is it a bargain?”</p>

<p>“Fellows, I’m an awful fool, I suppose, but—”
he paused again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<p>“Say it, Dick!” exclaimed George, with a grin.</p>

<p>“I want you to know that—that I appreciate your
confidence in me,” went on Dick, “and I’ll do the
best I know how.”</p>

<p>“Good boy!” cried Lanny, seizing Dick’s hand
and pumping it enthusiastically. “Now I feel as if
I could play some football! Honest, Dick, I’ve been
too worried to even try!”</p>

<p>“Do I—do I begin my duties now?” asked Dick
soberly.</p>

<p>“Of course! I suppose the Committee will have
to approve, but they’ll do that, all right.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Dick, “I’ll issue my first order.”</p>

<p>“Shoot!” laughed Lanny.</p>

<p>“Very well. The First Squad is disbanded.”</p>

<p>“Eh?” gasped Lanny.</p>

<p>“What?” exclaimed George.</p>

<p>“Also the Sub Team and the Third Squad,” continued
Dick calmly. “To-morrow at three o’clock
all candidates will report to me on the field dressed
to play.”</p>

<p>“What—what’s the idea?” asked Gordon.</p>

<p>“We’re going to start over,” returned Dick quietly,
“and any fellow who wants a place on the team
<em>has got to work for it</em>!”</p>

<small>THE NEW COACH TAKES HOLD</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Dick Lovering’s selection to mold the
destinies of the Clearfield High School Football
Team did not meet with universal approbation.
It would have been strange if it had.
Dick, handicapped as he was by his physical disability
and far too busy a youth to mix in many of the
school interests, had, after all, but a limited circle
of personal acquaintances, and those who knew him
only by sight and reputation were inclined to be
dissatisfied. There was no animosity toward Dick,
but it was felt that to put a boy who had never
played the game and had had no practical experience
at the head of football affairs was, to say the least,
a hazardous experiment. Some fellows went farther
and declared that it was idiotic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>

<p>“Dick Lovering’s all right,” they said, “but he’s a
cripple, and even if he knew how to coach the team,
he couldn’t do it on crutches! Wait till you hear
Springdale laugh at us when they hear it!”</p>

<p>Those who really knew Dick, on the other hand,
hailed his choice with satisfaction. Perhaps Tom
Haley voiced the general sentiment of this faction
as well as anyone. “I don’t care a bit,” he said,
“whether Dick knows a football from a baked potato.
If Dick undertakes to coach the team he’ll do
it and do it well. I never saw the thing yet that
Dick couldn’t do when he made up his mind to it.
And there isn’t a fellow in school who can make
what he says go as Dick can. We may not beat
Springdale this year, but if we don’t it won’t be
Dick’s fault!”</p>

<p>But whether the school in general approved or
disapproved, the matter was already beyond them
by the time they heard of it officially, which was
the noon following George Cotner’s announcement
on the steps. For Lanny had begged speedy action
by the Athletic Committee and a hurried meeting
had been held in Mr. Grayson’s office at eleven
o’clock. Curtis Wayland, who at Lanny’s solicitation
had risked the doctor’s displeasure and attended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
as one of the three undergraduate members,
informed Lanny afterwards that there had not been
a dissenting voice and that Mr. Grayson had been
highly pleased. “The selection of one of your own
kind, an undergraduate, a—a fellow with no taint
of professionalism,” he declared, “is right in line
with my theory that schoolboy sports and athletics
should be conducted by schoolboys and not by hired
mentors. I approve heartily, and I congratulate
White and the others on the good sense they have
displayed. And I wish Richard Lovering and the
team all success.”</p>

<p>The news was received with incredulous surprise
and at first the authenticity of it was doubted by
those not in the secret. Succeeding surprise, came
amusement, approbation or disapproval according to
the conviction of the person. At all events, the
matter created an excited interest that drove practically
the whole student body to the field that Tuesday
afternoon. Those who went to scoff, however,
found little opportunity. They saw Dick’s blue
auto standing at the end of the grandstand near the
big gate and discovered Dick himself, wearing his
honors very modestly, swinging about on his crutches
in a quiet and businesslike way, for all the world<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
as if he had been coaching football teams all his
short life.</p>

<p>But there was plenty of matter for surprise,
however. Instead of the usual spectacle of three
squads practicing independently of each other, they
found all the candidates, new and old, experienced
and inexperienced, democratically jumbled together
and performing the most elementary tasks!</p>

<p>Clearfield on the side lines was amused, to say
the least, at the spectacle of fellows like Haley,
Cottrell, Cable and even Lanny White himself, fellows
who had played for one, two and even three
years on the First Team as regulars or substitutes,
passing the ball to each other, falling on it, and
practicing starts and performing similar kindergarten
feats! Had it not been for this humorous aspect,
the spectators would have found practice that afternoon
distinctly uninteresting. There was no punting,
no line work, not even dummy practice. For a
solid hour and a half Clearfield’s football heroes,
proved and incipient, went through the veriest
drudgery and, on the whole, did it cheerfully.
Those of the audience who most disapproved of
the new coach had to acknowledge grudgingly that,
at least, Lovering had the courage of his convictions.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
And many marveled that the regulars accepted
the afternoon’s duties so uncomplainingly.
But those who marveled had not, of course, been
present in the dressing-room when Dick had made
his short speech to the assembled players.</p>

<p>His appearance had been greeted with a welcome
that must have pleased him, although if it did he
failed to show it. He was very quiet, very businesslike,
very terse. “First of all, fellows,” he announced
without preliminary rhetoric, “it must be understood
that you and I are here for just one thing.
That’s to get together a team that will beat Springdale.
If we can win other battles, well and good.
If we can’t, well and good. In order to beat Springdale
we’ve got to play regular football, fellows, and
in order to do that we’ve got to learn how. Some
of you know more football than others, but I’m
not going to take your words for it. To-day you
are all on the same level and we are going to start
all over, just as if this was the first day of practice
and you hadn’t already played one contest. There’s
no First Squad, no Scrub Team, no Third Squad
yet. Every fellow has got to show me what he
can do and for the next two or three days you will
all have to go back to elementary work. Those of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
you who aren’t willing to do that had better tell me
now and empty your lockers. There’s going to be
plenty of hard work for some time, perhaps all the
season; drudging work that isn’t exciting or spectacular
but that you’ve got to go through with if you
expect to face Springdale. I’d like every one of you
who goes on the field presently to do it with your
mind made up to do what you’re told without question
and to do it cheerfully. That’s the only way
you and I can work together to any sort of success.”</p>

<p>Dick nodded to Lanny and swung himself toward
the door, but paused there, for Lanny was
talking.</p>

<p>“That’s good straight talk, fellows,” Lanny was
saying earnestly, “and I second it. But Coach
Lovering mustn’t think he can frighten us by talking
hard work to us, for he can’t. We expect to work
hard and we want to work hard. We want to get
back at Springdale this year and wipe out what
happened last, fellows, and we aren’t going to mind
anything that happens so long as we can face
Springdale in November with an even chance to
win!”</p>

<p>The applause greeting that sentiment was spontaneous
and hearty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span></p>

<p>“There’s just one other thing, fellows,” Lanny
continued. “You all know the fellow who has just
spoken to you, and those of you who know him as
well as I do—or half as well—know that he will do
the very best he knows how for us. But it’s new
stuff to Dick and it’s not going to be any cinch for
him. So let’s help him all we can, remembering that
by helping him we’re helping ourselves and the
School. Let’s put our confidence in him, fellows,
let’s do what he tells us cheerfully and let’s make
up our minds that, no matter what—what discouragements
or failures may come, in the end we’re
going to be right there with the goods! Lovering
isn’t doing this for money, as most of you know,
for the Committee has seen to that. He’s doing it
because—well, because some of us pestered the life
out of him until he consented, and because he’s patriotic
enough to take over a mighty difficult and
thankless job when he can’t really afford the time it
will take. Now, fellows, let’s have a cheer for
Coach Lovering, and make it good!”</p>

<p>And it was good! And Dick, who had waited at
the door for Lanny to conclude, slipped out and,
with the whole-hearted acclaim from some forty
lusty throats following him, gazed thoughtfully<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
across the fading green of the field and silently
resolved to make good in this new and strange role
he had assumed.</p>

<p>That evening, after supper, Dick, Lanny, George
Cotner and Chester Cottrell met at Lanny’s house.
Cotner had prepared a list of candidates arranged
alphabetically at Dick’s request. When he received
the list Dick asked but one question: “Are all those
fellows eligible to play, George?”</p>

<p>“Yes, as far as I know. I have to take their
words for it, of course.”</p>

<p>“We won’t do that. I’ll hand this list to Mr.
Murray to-morrow and ask him to check it up.
Some of them may not have passed the examination
and we don’t want to waste time on any fellow who
may be taken away from us later on.”</p>

<p>Lanny looked doubtful. “We haven’t paid much
attention to physical examinations lately, Dick,” he
said. “I guess I could name half a dozen fellows
who haven’t been near Mr. Murray this Fall.”</p>

<p>“The rule is still in force, isn’t it?” asked Dick
in surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose so, but it’s a sort of dead letter
now.”</p>

<p>“It shouldn’t be, Lanny. We don’t want fellows<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
who are not sound and fit. We don’t want accidents
and we don’t want fellows petering out in
mid-season. So I guess we’ll have all those who
haven’t taken their exams do it to-morrow. Suppose
you write a notice to that effect, George, and
post it on the bulletin board. And write a call for
candidates, too, please. Say we want twenty more
fellows, must have them right away and don’t care
whether they’ve played football before or not.”</p>

<p>“You’ll get a lot of dubs if you say that,” volunteered
Cottrell dubiously.</p>

<p>“I don’t want dubs,” smiled Dick, “but I do want
to get hold of fellows who have strong bodies and
good lungs and plenty of brains. I’d rather make
a team out of eleven chaps with intelligence who
never saw a football than out of that many football
players without intelligence, Chester. Even if we
find only one out of the twenty who makes good it’ll
be worth the trouble.”</p>

<p>“Right-o,” said George. “Shove me some of
that pad over here, Lanny.”</p>

<p>“Now,” said Dick, “tell me what you know of
Springdale this year, fellows. I know what she did
to us last Fall and how she did it, but I want to
know what they are planning for this year and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
what sort of material they have. Anybody know?”</p>

<p>Lanny and Cottrell each shook his head. George
Cotner’s uninterrupted scratching with his pen signified
an equal ignorance.</p>

<p>“About all I know,” said Lanny finally, “is that
they’ve got six of last year’s team back and a number
of good subs.”</p>

<p>“Have they got the same backfield?”</p>

<p>“Pretty near. They lost Morgan.”</p>

<p>“Morgan was left half, wasn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Right half.”</p>

<p>“And the chap who out-punted us about ten
yards every time. Well, have they got another
punter in sight? Have they got anyone who is
clever at field-goals?”</p>

<p>“Search me,” responded Lanny. “We can find
out, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“We must, Lanny. We’ve got to know pretty
near what their line of attack is to be in order to
work up our defense. If they are going to form
their team around a clever drop-kicker we want to
know it. If they’re going to depend on the rushing
game entirely we want to know that. If they’re
going in strong for passing we want to know that.”</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said Cottrell, “the best thing to do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
is to send a scout to see them play next Saturday.”</p>

<p>Dick agreed. “But,” he added, “we won’t learn
much from such an early game, I think we’d better
subscribe to the Springdale papers and follow what
we see there. Until we can get a fair idea of what
Springdale’s line of attack is going to be we can’t
do much about our own defense. But there’s plenty
of time for that, fellows. I want to put in a good
three weeks of the old-fashioned football. We
don’t want to lose the game by a wretched fumble
or through lack of ordinary football sense. And
that’s about the way we lost last Fall.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, I guess,” agreed Cottrell. “You all
know I did all I could to lose that game!”</p>

<p>“You made mistakes, Chester,” said Dick, “and
so did most of the others. I’m not trying to
place the blame anywhere except on the team as
a whole. That’s where it belongs. But I don’t
want to see the same mistakes repeated this year.
And that’s why I want the fellows to learn football
from the ground up. And there are plenty
of them who began at the second story,” he added
dryly.</p>

<p>Lanny laughed. “That’s true, Dick. I felt myself
last Fall that Farrell wasn’t paying enough<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
attention to essentials. And we all know that he
paid so little heed to the subs that when we wanted
them we didn’t have second or third string players
who could do anything at all. I’m not trying to
put the loss of the game on Farrell, of course, but—well,
he did make mistakes. I suppose we all do.”</p>

<p>“Of course we do,” responded Dick cheerfully.
“Only let’s try and make as few as possible, and by
all means let’s make fewer than the other fellow.
Will you look after posting those notices, George,
the first thing in the morning?”</p>

<p>“So will do,” answered the manager. “Want to
see ’em?”</p>

<p>Dick read them over and approved. “Then that’s
all for this time, I guess,” he said, reaching for his
crutches. “I’ll be going on. Want a lift, Chester?”</p>

<p>“No, thanks, I’ll stay a while longer. Good night,
Dick. Here’s hoping!”</p>

<p>Dick smiled in the doorway.</p>

<p>“Here’s trying,” he corrected.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
<small>CLEARFIELD MEETS DEFEAT</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Locust Valley High School descended on
Clearfield the following Saturday, as Chester
Cottrell phrased it, “loaded for b’ar!” She
came with some two dozen capable-looking red-stockinged
youths, a head coach who had red hair—Dick
said that was a dangerous sign!—and a manager
who brought joy to the Clearfield supporters
by sporting a green alpine hat of the fuzzy variety.
Clearfield cheered delightedly when she first laid
eyes on that hat, and cheered at intervals throughout
the afternoon, whenever the wearer of the hat
showed activity.</p>

<p>Locust Valley found Clearfield unprepared. The
line-up that started the first period for the Purple
amazed most of the fellows and displeased those
who pretended to be football authorities. Why, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
the name of all that was sensible, should Egbert
Peyton be playing right tackle? Equally incongruous
to them was the presence of George Tupper at
right half, of Pete Robey at left guard and of
Ambrose Smith at right end. “It’s a wonder,” some
critics grumbled, “he’s let Lanny White play!”</p>

<p>Defeat for Clearfield was a foregone conclusion
after the first five minutes of play. Clearfield got
her signals mixed, utterly failed to follow the ball
closely, was fooled on the simplest plays and, on
the whole, put up as wretched an exhibition of football
as one can imagine. Locust Valley was well
advanced for so early in the season, her warriors
had a diversified attack that was hard to meet and
her coach was a tactician of merit. At the end of
the first period Locust Valley had scored a touchdown
by a mixture of old-fashioned line-plunging
and new-fashioned cross-passing and had kicked a
goal. Clearfield had not succeeded in even threatening
the opponent’s citadel.</p>

<p>Dick imperturbably put Harry Bryan in at left
end and Thad Brimmer at center and the game went
on. Clearfield showed occasional flashes of real
football, as when, half-way through the second period,
Lanny, with Cottrell interfering, ran some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
thirty yards straight through the opponents and
placed the pigskin on Locust Valley’s twenty-three
yards. But after that the Purple’s offense was too
weak to make much impression on the enemy and the
ball was soon being punted back up the field. Clearfield
showed almost no team-play. It was every man
for himself, and some of the individual efforts were
extremely crude. The team’s supporters hoped
against hope well into that second period and then
began to grumble. Some of the things that were
said about the team and about the coach were uncomplimentary
in the extreme. The kindest thing
that was muttered of Dick by these malcontents
was that he didn’t know enough football to coach
a girl’s school! The first half ended with the score
11 to 0, Locust Valley having failed to kick a goal
from a difficult angle.</p>

<p>To make a long story short, the enemy departed
later in the afternoon with the ball and a 26 to 3
victory. That three points Clearfield managed to
secure in the last five minutes of the battle by the
timely introduction of Morris Brent. Coach Lovering
used practically three elevens that day, and, considering
the sort of game put up by some of the
players, it was a wonder that Locust Valley didn’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
double her score! Clearfield retired from the field
in a mutinous mood. There was even talk of a
mass meeting to protest against the further retention
of Dick as coach. Clearfield, they said bitterly,
had never been beaten as badly as that in the memory
of any student, and only once before had she
failed to win from Locust Valley. It was all very
well to make the Springdale game the goal of the
season’s work, but there was no sense in being licked
by every little whipper-snapper of an opponent
meanwhile. Why hadn’t Lovering used the team
that had beaten Highland Hall last Saturday instead
of experimenting with every kid who had the
price of a pair of canvas trousers?</p>

<p>Dick had his defenders, of course, but they were
in the minority. As for Dick himself, he showed
no concern over the outcome of that contest.
George Cotner, whose confidence in Dick had been
somewhat shaken that afternoon, ventured to offer
condolences after the game.</p>

<p><a href="#i_084fp">“Too bad, Dick,” he said. “Still, we did score
on ’em.</a> I suppose, considering everything, we
couldn’t have expected to win.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_084fp">
  <img src="images/i_084fp.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_84">“‘Too bad, Dick,’ he said. ‘Still, we did score on ’em.’”</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>“Probably not,” replied Dick calmly. “Let me
have your memorandum, please. I want to go over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
it to-night. By the way, can you find a fellow to
help with the dummy on Monday?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll get one of the kids. We’ll have to buy
some more balls in a day or two, Dick. We lost
one to-day, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and we may lose more. You’d better order
a half-dozen on Monday.”</p>

<p>George confided that evening to Cottrell that Dick
didn’t seem much worried by the day’s fiasco.</p>

<p>“Why should he?” asked Chester loyally, observing
the manager with a disapproving scowl. “Who
cares what Locust Valley does if we can get a
team that will beat Springdale?”</p>

<p>“I know,” George hastened to say, “but seems to
me it’s a bad idea to let any team walk over us the
way Locust Valley did. It—it sort of destroys
confidence. Besides, just between you and me,
Chester, the fellows don’t like it much. I’ve heard
talk of a meeting to protest.”</p>

<p>Chester shrugged his square shoulders and
grinned. “Let ’em,” he said shortly. “Much good
it’ll do ’em. Dick Lovering’s coach and he’s going to
be coach. We all agreed to give him a free rein
and he’s going to have it. It seems to me the best
thing you can do is to stand up for him, George.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>

<p>“I am!” declared the other, scandalized by the
insinuation. “I do! I’ve been telling fellows all
the afternoon that Dick knows what he’s doing and
that if he wants to lose every game but the Springdale
game he has a perfect right to do it!”</p>

<p>“All right. Then don’t talk as if you thought
he didn’t have any sense.” And Chester turned
away with a scowl that, because of a strip of
dirty white plaster on his cheek-bone, made him look
quite ferocious.</p>

<p>Dick’s request for twenty more candidates resulted
in the appearance of some eight or ten youths,
mostly of tender years and all without football experience.
Cotner and Lanny viewed the volunteers
pessimistically, but Dick failed to exhibit any disappointment
at the result of his summons. He added
the new fellows to the rest and went diligently
on. On Monday there was a full hour of dummy-tackling,
and fellows who had prided themselves
on their ability in that line had much of the conceit
taken out of them. Dick’s knowledge of tackling
surprised even Lanny and Gordon and others who
believed the most firmly in his ability to lead Clearfield
to victory. For a fellow who had never handled
a pigskin, he certainly had a whole lot of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
knowledge stowed away in that head of his! He
fell foul of Tom Haley early in the proceedings and
the fact that Tom was a very good friend of his
made no difference in his speech.</p>

<p>“How long have you been playing, Tom?” asked
Dick coldly as the last year’s center picked himself
up from the dirt.</p>

<p>“Three or four years,” answered Tom in some
surprise, pausing in the act of rubbing the soil from
his face.</p>

<p>“Then you ought to be ashamed to tackle like
that,” said Dick severely. “Try it again, please.
And remember that the idea is to <em>stop</em> the man and
not tickle him under the knees!”</p>

<p>Tom flushed, choked down a retort that his companions
in the line surmised was none too patient
and poised himself again while the swaying dummy
once more crossed the pit.</p>

<p>“Now get into it!” urged Dick. “Stop him! Put
him back!”</p>

<p>Perhaps chagrin was responsible for what ensued.
Tom made a hard dive and whipped his arms out
for the canvas body, but in some way the dummy
eluded him and Tom rolled over sprawling on his
back, while the stuffed figure, with its faded C, went<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
dancing crazily on its way. Tom picked himself
up, angrily aware of the amused expressions on the
faces of the others, and, brushing his hands absorbedly,
took up his position again at the end of the
line. Dick said nothing. Another candidate hurled
himself at the dummy, with a rattle and bang of
chain and pulley, and then another and another.
Dick awarded each one a word of criticism, approving
or disparaging. “Better, Way.” “All right,
Jack.” “Rotten, Bert. Get in front and not behind.”
“Brimmer, you act as if you were afraid
of it! Try it again.” Ultimately it was once more
Tom Haley’s turn, and Tom had a little disk of
white on each cheek as he watched Manager Cotner
pull the dummy back and lay hold of the other rope.
An expectant silence fell. Dick nodded and the
figure started across the pit on its iron trolley.
Tom, hands clenched, ran forward a few steps and
launched himself. His arms enwrapped the dummy’s
thighs, there was a mighty grunt from Tom
and the sound of ripping canvas, and tackler and
dummy reposed in the dirt while the chain and ring
sped jangling around the block toward the further
end. A burst of hilarity greeted the performance.
Dick smiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span></p>

<p>“That’s the way to do it, Tom,” he approved
heartily as Tom tossed the dummy from his prostrate
form and arose, “and I’d like to see every one
of you tear it off the ring every time! Get a new
strap made for that by to-morrow, George, please.
That’s all for to-day, fellows. On the trot now.
Two laps around the field before you go in.”</p>

<p>The mass meeting didn’t materialize. No one had
really expected it to. What had seemed a catastrophe
on Saturday had become merely an unfortunate
incident by Monday. No one, you may be sure,
had mentioned the matter to Dick, but he was not
in ignorance of the sentiment of the school in general.
But if it bothered him he made no sign. He
went on his way smiling. Even when on the next
Wednesday it became known that Will Horsford
had been forbidden further participation in football
by reason of a weak heart discovered in the
course of a physical examination by Mr. Murray,
and the fellows learned that Dick had insisted on
a revival of a regulation that had become virtually
a dead letter and criticism was rampant, Dick appeared
to be quite unaware of it. Horsford was
a good player, a lineman who had performed
creditably at guard and tackle for two seasons, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
there was no contradicting the assertion so loudly
made that the team had lost one of its best men.
Dick’s course in insisting on physical examinations
for the candidates was labeled absurd.</p>

<p>“What’s the good,” fellows asked, “of reviving
that rot? If Faculty is satisfied why do we need to
complain? And look what the result is! One of
the best players we had lost to us!”</p>

<p>Nor was the explanation of Dick’s friends that it
was good policy to take no chances with fellows
physically weak and so liable to injury accepted as
sufficient. “Lovering’s too much of a granny for
this job,” was the answer. “He ought to be coaching
the grammar school team!”</p>

<p>On Thursday Dick began the formation of a
First Squad—Squad A he called it—and to it he
gathered an even two dozen. The balance he formed
into Squad B. There were some surprises in
that partitioning. Page Kent, right guard in the
Highland Hall game, was relegated to Squad B,
as was Jack Toll, right end. Guy Felker, who
had always played half or fullback, was tried out
as end, and Fudge Shaw was made unintelligible
for days by being placed on Squad A amongst the
candidates for the position of guard. Harry Partridge,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
who had started the season as captain of
the Scrub, found himself elevated to the upper
squad, and it was Tom Nostrand who fell heir to
his honor. That alone was sufficient to excite comment,
for Nostrand had never shown any particular
ability as a player. He had, however, a full set of
brains, as Dick pointed out to Lanny when the latter
showed surprise at the selection.</p>

<p>“Nostrand won’t make a first-class player in a
hundred years,” said Dick with conviction, “but,
unless I’m away off my track, he’s just the fellow
to run the Scrubs. He’s smart, thinks like lightning,
can handle fellows and knows the way things
ought to be done even if he can’t do them. I expect
him to work out a mighty good team of what
he’s got to work on.”</p>

<p>Dick’s prediction proved correct, although the
fact didn’t appear just yet. On Saturday the eleven
journeyed to Norrisville and played the Norrisville
Academy team. The forty or fifty supporters who
made the trip with the team scarcely looked for a
victory for the Purple, for rumor credited the
Academy with being unusually strong this Fall,
while it wasn’t apparent to the Clearfield rooters
that Dick’s aggregation was one whit better than a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
week before. But their expressions of resigned
gloom were speedily turned to looks of surprised
delight, for Clearfield set about things in a hearty,
not-to-be-denied manner that amazed Norrisville as
much as it did the Clearfield supporters.</p>

<p>The Purple started with Bryan, left end, Partridge,
left tackle, Cable, left guard, Haley, center,
A. Beaton, right guard, Scott, right tackle, Felker,
right end, Cottrell, quarter, White, left half, Tupper,
right half and N. Beaton, fullback. There
was much more coherence apparent than there had
been a week ago, although real team-play was yet
to be discovered. Cottrell ran the eleven in excellent
shape and chose his plays better than he ever had.
The attack, while restricted to only a half-dozen
plays, had power and the defense really deserved
the name.</p>

<p>Nelson Beaton, at full, was the man of the day,
for he showed a quite unsuspected ability to gain
through the line and his plunges were hard to stop
until he was well into the secondary defense. At
end, Felker showed promise but was still too unaccustomed
to the duties of the position to be entirely
satisfactory. Scott was weak at right tackle.
Partridge did well at left tackle and Bryan, on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
wing at that end, was almost spectacular. Just to
prove that they knew something besides hitting the
line, Cottrell got three forward passes away for
good gains in the first half. Thereafter the Purple
stuck to old-style football, playing on the defensive
for most of the time. For, with 17 points to their
credit against the opponent’s 6, why worry, as Chester
Cottrell put it?</p>

<p>Norrisville earned her one touchdown, which came
to her in the second period, by taking advantage of
a fumble by Tupper of a punt which nearly went
over his head. Norrisville fell on the rolling ball
on Clearfield’s twenty-two yards and, using a shift
which completely fooled her opponent, smashed
straight through Scott for a score. Of Clearfield’s
two touchdowns, Lanny made one and Nelson Beaton
the other, and in each case a goal was secured.
The remaining three points were secured by an easy
drop-kick from the twenty-three yards which went
neatly across the bar. That was Morris Brent’s
usual contribution and he was taken out again soon
after.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most encouraging feature of that
game was the showing of Partridge at left tackle.
To immediately discover a player capable of stepping<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
into the shoes of the disbarred Horsford was
a fine piece of luck and did much toward reconciling
the fellows to the loss of the former tackle and
exonerating Dick of the blame. It was generally
conceded after the Norrisville High game that Coach
Lovering had really done very well with the team
in the scant ten days he had been at the helm. And
doubtless he had, although it must be taken into
consideration that Norrisville had not presented a
very strong team.</p>

<p>Dick took eighteen players with him that afternoon
and gave each of them a chance at some time
during the game. Gordon Merrick, whom he had
placed on Squad A, went in for the whole fourth
period. Gordon was Dick’s closest friend and it
may be that he had allowed his friendship to somewhat
sway his judgment, for Dick was only human.
In any case, the result had been disappointing, and
Dick intimated as much that evening when the two
boys were walking downtown to the Auditorium
to see the moving pictures.</p>

<p>“I think,” said Dick, “you can play a better game
than you did to-day, Gordie. What was the
trouble?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Gordon ruefully. “I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
guess I was pretty poor, though. I don’t believe
there’s much use wasting time on me, Dick. I’d
never play half as well as George Tupper.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to have you on the team,” said Dick
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“I’d like to make it, too, but—well, I guess I’m
no born football player, Dickums.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t such a thing as a born football player,
Gordie. You see what you can do this week,
will you? You know I want to give you every
chance, but I can’t afford to play any favorites.
You understand, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Of course! I wouldn’t want you to, Dickums.
I’ll do my level best and if I don’t make a heap
better showing you drop me. Don’t think I’m
going to be peevish about it. I know perfectly well
I haven’t any business on the First. So do you.”</p>

<p>Dick laughed. “Well, we’ll see. To be frank,
Gordie, you haven’t shown up as well as Tupper
or Hansard, and I can’t very well keep more than
two substitute halves. In fact, to stay with Squad
A you’ll have to beat out either Hansard or McCoy.
Unless—” Dick hesitated and it was not until they
had crossed Main Street that he continued. Then,
“I wonder how you’d shape up at end, Gordie.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span></p>

<p>“Try me,” said Gordon. “I’ve never played end.
But, say, you’ve got all kinds of good ends, Dick!
Bryan was a wonder to-day, and then there’s Felker
and Toll and Grover. Still, I’d like to try. I’m
a pretty rotten halfback, that’s certain!”</p>

<p>“All right. I’ll try you to-morrow. We must
be late. Look at the mob at the door!”</p>

<p>“There’s Fudge and Harry. I’ll ask them to get
our tickets.” And Gordon, whose turn it was to
treat, slipped his two dimes into Fudge’s hand just
as that youth reached the window where sat the
resplendent ticket seller.</p>

<p>“Hello, Gordon! Two? Sure! Four of your
best tickets, please!” The latter remark was addressed
to the ticket seller and elicited only a
haughty stare and four little blue tickets torn from
a seemingly endless strip. But Fudge chuckled at
his own joke, quite unaffected by the man’s hauteur,
and the four boys crowded through the door and
sought seats together in the darkened house.</p>

<p>The Auditorium prided itself on being very high-class
and Fudge was soon grumbling about the sort
of photo-plays being presented. “Gee,” he confided
to Dick, “these pictures make me tired! They
never have anything exciting any more. Say, know<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
what I’m going to do? Well, I’m going to make
that story I’m writing into a ‘movie’ play. How’s
that?”</p>

<p>“Great!” said Dick. “How are you getting on
with it?”</p>

<p>“Pretty well,” answered the other with a sudden
lapse of enthusiasm. “The trouble is I don’t seem
able to work it out. You see, the fellow who murdered
the old codger, Middleton, had to get into
that room somehow, didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“I suppose he did,” agreed Dick.</p>

<p>“Well, but how could he? There were bars at
the window and the door was locked inside.”</p>

<p>“I guess he committed suicide, Fudge.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t have,” responded Fudge decidedly.
“The wound was on the back of his head.”</p>

<p>“You could change that, couldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Y-yes, but that wouldn’t do. He had to be
murdered so that Young Sleuth could unravel the
mystery, don’t you see? I thought maybe I’d have
it that the murderer was hidden somewhere in the
room and escaped afterwards, but Young Sleuth
looked everywhere. There’s six pages about his
examination of the room and his finding a clew.”</p>

<p>“What sort of a clew did he find?” asked Dick,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
trying to seem interested in Fudge’s conversation
and at the same time follow the story being thrown
on the screen.</p>

<p>“Finger-prints,” confided Fudge, “and a piece of
torn paper with three words on it.”</p>

<p>“Fine! What were the words?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know yet. I haven’t got to that. Young
Sleuth found the paper and didn’t let on he had it.
Detective stories are awfully hard to write. But
it would make a dandy ‘movie’!”</p>

<p>By that time the patience of those sitting in the
neighborhood was exhausted and Fudge was requested
to stop talking. He subsided with a grin,
but a close observer would have seen that he was
not paying much heed to the polite adventures of
the beautiful heroine of the photo-play. Instead of
looking toward the stage he fixed his gaze on the
bald head of the man in front of him and surreptitiously
munched chestnuts. When, finally, the play
ended with a moonlight scene in which virtue was
brilliantly triumphant, Fudge grunted his disapproval
and once more turned to Dick.</p>

<p>“I’ve got it!” he whispered hoarsely.</p>

<p>“Got what?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“The solution! Old Middleton was attacked outside<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
the room and went in there and locked the door
himself! How’s that?”</p>

<p>“That might do,” conceded Dick, “but how about
the clews?”</p>

<p>Fudge’s face fell. “That’s so. I guess I could
change that about the clews, though. What’s this
fellow going to do? Play a banjo? Gee, this is
a bum show!”</p>

<small>THE COMMITTEE IN SESSION</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“Sixty-two dollars and sixty-five cents,” announced
Louise Brent disconsolately. “I
don’t believe we’ll ever get enough!”</p>

<p>“I wonder who gave the five cents,” murmured
Lanny.</p>

<p>The Twenty-fifth of October Fund Committee
was assembled on the side porch at Brentwood,
facing a problem.</p>

<p>“We need about twenty-eight dollars more, don’t
we?” asked Gordon. Louise nodded.</p>

<p>“Unless we left off the filing-cabinet,” she
said.</p>

<p>“How much less would that make it?”</p>

<p>“We figured the cabinet at eighteen dollars.
Maybe it would be less, though.”</p>

<p>“Eighteen,” reminded Morris, “was before we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
took off thirty per cent. So it would only make
it about twelve dollars.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I so hoped we could get the cabinet
too,” said Louise.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve tackled about everyone in school,”
said Gordon. “I can give another dollar, I guess,
but that doesn’t help much.”</p>

<p>“The trouble is,” said Morris, “that most of the
fellows are down on Mr. Grayson about the coaching
business.”</p>

<p>“Don’t see why they should be,” said Lanny,
“after Saturday’s game. Seems to me that ought
to prove that we can win without paying money
for a professional coach.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” agreed Morris hurriedly, darting an
anxious glance at Dick, fearing he had said something
to hurt him. “Maybe they think differently
about it now. How would it do to ask fellows again?”</p>

<p>Gordon groaned. “I absolutely refuse,” he asserted.
“If we have got to do that someone will
have to take my list.”</p>

<p>“How many are there who haven’t been asked?”
inquired May Burnham.</p>

<p>“Only about twenty,” replied Louise, “and most
of them are the younger boys.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span></p>

<p>“And they don’t give much, anyway,” said Gordon.
“We may be able to make up another five
dollars, but I guess that’s about all. There’s only
two weeks more, about.”</p>

<p>“Well, supposing we got seventy dollars altogether,”
asked Dick. “Is there anything we could
do without, so as to bring the whole bill to seventy?”</p>

<p>Louise referred to her list. “The easy-chair
would be about fourteen,” she replied. “But we
simply couldn’t do without that, Dick.”</p>

<p>“No, the easy-chair seems rather necessary. By
the way, how much of the sixty-two is actually
paid?”</p>

<p>“Thirty-seven dollars and twenty-five cents. I
don’t suppose we’ll get it all, either, by the time we
need it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll borrow the difference from father,” said
Morris. “He will let us have it, I guess. I dare say
I could afford to contribute another dollar or two.”</p>

<p>“There’s no reason why you should,” declared
Nell Sawin. “I think it’s a shame that we can’t
make up a small amount like that. The girls have
given almost half again as much as the boys. They
ought to be ashamed of themselves!” This was
quite severe for Nell, who was normally incapable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
of censure, and Lanny was moved to a defense of
his sex.</p>

<p>“We have more things to spend our money on
than you girls,” he said. “Besides, there are more
girls than boys in school, Nell.”</p>

<p>“Only about ten,” said Louise severely, tapping
her teeth with the tip of her brother’s fountain pen.
“We’ve just got to get some more money.”</p>

<p>“Let’s have a fair,” suggested May, and Grace
Lovering, who had not contributed to the discussion,
clapped her hands.</p>

<p>“Let’s!” she said. “We could easily make twenty
dollars, Louise!”</p>

<p>“Fairs are no earthly use,” was the reply. “Not
when you really want to make anything. It always
costs nearly as much as you take in to get ready.
We’d have to make things or get folks to give
us things to sell, and there isn’t time. We
might—might have an entertainment, though.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t time for that, either,” said Morris.
“Besides, no one would come.”</p>

<p>At that moment Lanny, who had been thoughtfully
silent for a minute, said: “I think I’ve got
it, folks, but you’ll have to give me a day or two
to mull it over. No questions, please!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, Lanny, have you really?” demanded Nell
eagerly. “What is it? A show?”</p>

<p>“No questions, I said,” laughed Lanny. “I’ll tell
you on—let me see; this is Monday—on Wednesday
evening. We’ll have another meeting then, if you
like. Meanwhile you folks get busy with those who
haven’t been asked yet and see what can be done.
I’d like to know how much we have to make before
I—spring my scheme on you.”</p>

<p>“I’m so glad someone’s thought of something,”
declared Louise, with a sigh of relief. “We’ll meet
again Wednesday, then. Did—did anyone say he
wanted to subscribe some more?” And Louise
held her list out invitingly. Lanny took it and
added his name for another dollar. Dick shook
his head with a smile.</p>

<p>“I’d like to, but I’m afraid I can’t, Louise.”</p>

<p>“Never mind. Gordon, you said you would,
didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I believe I did,” sighed Gordon, accepting
the paper and taking the pen from Lanny. “And
just to prove that a Merrick is as good as his
word and a little better I’ll put my name down
here for—for a dollar and—let me see; if one ice-cream
soda costs ten cents, two ice-cream sodas<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
would cost twenty cents. Wouldn’t they, Lanny?”</p>

<p>“What on earth are you talking about?” asked
Louise.</p>

<p>“There; one dollar and twenty cents,” said Gordon,
writing. “I’ll take cash for those sodas,
Lanny.”</p>

<p>“What sodas? Somebody feel his head, please!”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry about my head, old chap. All
you have to do is fork over twenty cents.”</p>

<p>“What’s it for? Do I owe you twenty cents?”</p>

<p>“You owe me two sodas, Lanny, or, to be exact,
you owe me one soda and yourself one soda. Being
a philanthropist I donate the price of the sodas to
this worthy cause.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that I bet the sodas with you?”</p>

<p>“Ex-act-ly! You bet me we wouldn’t have a football
coach within a week and I bet you we would.
And we did. Twenty cents, please!”</p>

<p>“Thunder! So I did!” laughed Lanny, fumbling
in his pocket. “But, hold on! Are you sure we
got him within the week?”</p>

<p>“Positive,” declared Gordon with conviction.
“We made the wager the night of the last meeting
of this committee, which was a Tuesday. We
secured our present capable coach at about nine-forty-five<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
the following Monday evening. Anything
more to say?”</p>

<p>“No, here’s your old twenty cents. Only it’s a
quarter. Got a nickel?”</p>

<p>“I may have,” replied Gordon untroubledly, “but
I don’t intend to look. I’ll just change that twenty
cents to twenty-five and so save trouble. There we
are! And here’s the cash, Louise. Put your little
cross opposite my name, please.”</p>

<p>After that Morris insisted on giving another dollar
and Nell fifty cents. “I haven’t the slightest
idea where I’ll get it,” declared the latter tragically.
“I’ll just have to do something and make some
money. Perhaps I’ll sell matches on the street
corner! Or—or have a lemonade stand in the front
yard!”</p>

<p>“If you do please see that the lemonade is hot,”
said Lanny. “Cold lemonade in this weather
wouldn’t go very fast.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Louise, rising, “I suppose you don’t
want any, Lanny. Never mind, I dare say the rest
of us can drink it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” replied Lanny carelessly, “if you have
it all made— Rather than seem unappreciative,
you know——”</p>

<small>LANNY EXPLAINS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Dick was a very busy person those days. He
had not deceived himself into thinking that
coaching the High School Football Team
would entail but little time and effort. His mistake
had been in underestimating the amount of labor and
time involved. Actual outdoor work took up a good
two hours and a half every day save Sunday. Then
at least five evenings a week Lanny and George Cotner,
and often one or other of the players besides,
met at his house and discussed progress, made plans,
corrected mistakes, worked out formations and plays
and conducted a sort of general football conference.
This lasted anywhere from one to two hours, and
after the others had gone Dick had to settle down
at his books. Fortunately the senior year at high
school was, in comparison with the years gone before,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
fairly easy, and Dick usually managed to do a
good part of his preparation during the day, between
classes. If he had not he would have been forced to
yield either his position as football coach or his
attendance at the High School!</p>

<p>But even the period in the afternoon and the one
or two hours in the evening did not comprise all the
time given to football, for Dick found that it was
impossible to clear his mind of gridiron affairs at
other moments. They obtruded when he tried to
study, even when he was at his meals and often kept
him awake at night when he should have been asleep.
He was forever pulling out the little black note-book
he carried in a vest pocket and jotting down a memorandum
in it, and he got so he even went off into
thought-trances when folks were talking to him!
As when one evening at supper his sister Grace consulted
him with regard to some problem connected
with the new heating system which he was having
installed in the cottage. Dick listened with apparent
attention, his eyes on his plate, until Grace had finished.
Then he surprised that young lady by looking
up and remarking thoughtfully: “That end-around
play won’t go unless we can keep the ball out of
sight until the runner reaches the line.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span></p>

<p>Grace declared that he was losing his mind.</p>

<p>One of Dick’s duties was to follow the progress
of the Springdale High School Team as reflected in
the columns of the <cite>Springdale Morning Recorder</cite>.
The accounts of the team’s practice sessions were
not very voluminous, but they appeared to be reported
by a high school boy and were doubtless, as
far as they went, authentic. Dick usually clipped the
articles from the paper and they were discussed at
the meetings. It was on the Tuesday evening following
the Norrisville game that Lanny again
broached the subject of sending someone to see
Springdale play. “We can’t tell much by this newspaper
stuff,” he said. “We’ve found out who they’ll
probably use against us, but we don’t know what sort
of a game they’re planning. I think we ought to see
them play Benton next Saturday and get a line on
them. Could you go over, Dick?”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you go?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“Why, I suppose I could,” replied Lanny doubtfully.
“Only—well, we play Logan, and Logan has
a pretty fair team, I guess.”</p>

<p>“What of it? McCoy will do well enough. I’d
go along, but I guess one of us had better stay here.
You take Chester with you, Lanny. He’s good at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
sizing things up. Besides, that would give you a
chance to watch the backfield and let him watch the
linemen. Kirke can play quarter for us Saturday.”</p>

<p>“But I’d hate to have Logan beat us,” Lanny objected.
“Suppose you and Chester go, Dick.”</p>

<p>Dick smiled and George Cotner chuckled audibly.
Lanny flushed.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t think that we are going to lose the
game just because I’m not here,” he said. “Only—oh,
I don’t know! I’ll do just as you say, Dick.”</p>

<p>“Then you’ll go; you and Chester,” replied Dick.
“Later on I’ll see them in action myself, but I’d
rather wait until about a week before we play them.
Let me see; who do they meet the Saturday before
they play us?” Dick turned the pages of a scrapbook
and found the Springdale schedule. “Weston
Academy, eh? Where’s that?”</p>

<p>“Up-state,” replied George. “A small school.
Springdale’s evidently looking for an easy game that
day.”</p>

<p>“Then she won’t show much,” mused Dick.
“Still, I could get away that afternoon very nicely,
for we play the grads.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe they’ll ever get together to play
us,” said George. “Fosdick told me Saturday that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
he was having a hard time getting the fellows to
promise. If they don’t we’ll be in a hole. I told
Means last Winter that he couldn’t depend on the
grads for a game.”</p>

<p>“Well, we won’t cross that bridge until we come
to it,” said Dick. “Maybe if the grads don’t turn
up we can find another team to play us. If we can’t
we can have a pretty good afternoon of practice, and
I dare say that will be quite as much good to us.”</p>

<p>“Then you think Chester and I had better go to
Springdale Saturday?” asked Lanny not over-enthusiastically.
Dick nodded.</p>

<p>“Yes, I do, Lanny. See what they look like and
how their backfield shapes up. And above all watch
their formations. If they show anything new don’t
miss it. Better jot it down at the time. And find
out if you can whether they’ve got a man who can
kick goals from the field. A good deal will depend
on that. Bring back everything you can, Lanny.
Every little bit helps.”</p>

<p>“All right. You won’t take any chances with
that Logan game, though, will you, Dick?” he
pleaded. “You know they tied us last year.”</p>

<p>“Bother your old Logan game!” laughed Dick.
“If you say much more about it I’ll forfeit it to them!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
Seriously, though, Lanny, that game doesn’t mean
much to us, and if I can scrape through without
being absolutely beaten I’ll be satisfied. Just keep
your eyes on the eighteenth of November, Lanny,
and forget about what goes on before.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” Lanny agreed, “only—when
you’re captain you sort of like to do the best you can;
make a good showing for the season, you know.”</p>

<p>“A good showing isn’t possible unless we beat
Springdale,” replied Dick emphatically, “and that’s
what we’re working for. I don’t much care if we
lose every game from now till then, if we win that
one. Now let’s get at those plays. This No. 3
won’t work out, I guess. We’re taking too many
men from the right of the line and we’re giving the
play away from the start. There’s one thing we’ve
got to keep in mind, fellows, and that is that the
simpler our plays are the better they’ll work. If we
decide on that formation we’ve talked of our plays
have got to be simple. I don’t mind trying this
No. 6 out in practice if you like, but I don’t cheer
for it much.”</p>

<p>“Just the same, if it did fool them,” suggested
George, “it would fool them badly and we’d make
yards on it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<p>“But I don’t think it would fool them,” said Dick.
“Not more than once, anyhow. And there’s no use
learning a play that can be used no more than once
in a game. Frankly, fellows, I don’t set much score
on fancy formations and funny shifts and trick plays.
They don’t pan out well. Of course, if your opponent
is weak you can make anything go, but we’re
planning for Springdale, and Springdale isn’t weak.
She knows a lot of football. Why, that No. 6
would be smeared to the hilt the second time we
tried it, if not the first. With all due regard to you,
Lanny, I’m going to forget that play.”</p>

<p>And Dick rolled the sheet of paper up and tossed
it into the waste-basket.</p>

<p>“Alas, poor child of my brain!” murmured
George.</p>

<p>“Was that yours?” asked Dick. “I thought
Lanny did that.”</p>

<p>“No, mine was that quarterback-run play,” said
Lanny.</p>

<p>“Oh! Well, I’m sorry, George. If you want me
to I’ll try it out.”</p>

<p>“No, don’t bother. I dare say you’re quite right
about it. It <em>is</em> a bit involved.”</p>

<p>“All right. Try again, George. Only keep them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
simple. Plays that use only two men are a heap
better than those requiring half a dozen to mess
around and get in each other’s way. Now, here’s
this No. 8. I like that, Lanny. Was that yours?”</p>

<p>Lanny shook his head regretfully. “No, that’s
one that Corwin sprang on us last Fall. I changed
it a bit, that’s all. They pulled it off from a forward-pass
formation, but that seemed to me to limit it a
good deal. I thought it would be a good play to
work from regular formation.”</p>

<p>“I think it would. And if we can get that formation
of ours to working right it would be a good
play to add to that 4 and 5 sequence. We’ll lay it
aside for now, though. What we want for the next
fortnight is about three more plays outside of tackle.
Now let’s get busy.”</p>

<p>The Twenty-fifth of October Fund Committee
met as arranged on Wednesday night, all members
present save Grace Lovering, whose regrets were
formally expressed by Dick.</p>

<p>“She isn’t sick, is she?” asked Louise concernedly.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” replied Dick gravely. “She is in
most robust health. To relieve your kind anxiety,
Louise, I’ll state that to-night is bread-making night
at our house.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span></p>

<p>“Oh!” laughed Louise. “That’s it! Can Grace
really make bread, Dick?”</p>

<p>“None better. When last seen she was up to her
elbows in dough.”</p>

<p>“I think that’s awfully clever of her,” said Nell
Sawin. “I wish I could do it. Don’t you, May?”</p>

<p>May Burnham, who had received Dick’s announcement
with surprise, agreed somewhat doubtfully.
May had always considered household duties
rather below the dignity of one who was so closely
related to the wealthy and influential Brents, but,
observing that Louise seemed to think Grace Lovering’s
accomplishment something to be proud of
instead of ashamed of, she added, with more enthusiasm:
“I think it must be very nice to be able to
do things like that”; and secretly wondered whether
her own views were mistaken. Certainly, she reflected,
none of the others seemed at all shocked
by Dick’s confession.</p>

<p>Presently they got down to business and Louise,
as treasurer, announced the fund now totaled sixty-eight
dollars and eighty cents. “And,” she added,
“I think that’s all we can get from the students.
We’ve seen all the girls except one, who is ill, and
Dick and Gordon have seen most of the boys.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span></p>

<p>“All but three,” replied Dick, “and they won’t
subscribe more than a quarter apiece, I guess.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Lanny. “That leaves us about
twenty-one dollars behind then. To-day’s the
eleventh, isn’t it? And Mr. Grayson’s birthday
is the twenty-fifth, and that’s just two weeks
from to-day. When are you planning to buy the
things?”</p>

<p>“I suppose we ought to do it a week ahead,” said
Morris. “It may take three or four days for them
to get here by freight.”</p>

<p>“Maybe longer,” said Dick. “I wouldn’t leave it
much after the fifteenth.”</p>

<p>“The fifteenth is Sunday,” Morris reminded.
“We might go to New York the next day, though.”</p>

<p>“Who’s going?” asked Gordon.</p>

<p>“Louise and May and I, unless some of you fellows
want to go along.”</p>

<p>“I guess none of us could get away,” responded
Dick. “You’ll have to cut recitations, won’t you,
though?”</p>

<p>“Only one. We’ll take the two-twelve train and
that’ll give us nearly three hours before the stores
close. We can get back by eight. If we can get
everything at Marsden’s it won’t take more than an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
hour or so. Father agreed last night to advance
what money we need and we’re to pay him back as
fast as we collect from the students.”</p>

<p>“We have almost fifty dollars paid in now,” said
Louise. “So we won’t have to borrow more than
forty from father.”</p>

<p>“How about the expenses of your trip?” Lanny
asked.</p>

<p>“We’ll each pay our own,” replied Louise. “It’s
only fair, because it’s going to be rather fun. I wish
we might all go.”</p>

<p>“It will be all right if I cut practice that day, won’t
it?” asked Morris.</p>

<p>Dick nodded. “For that matter,” he said, “Lanny
and Gordon may go as far as practice is concerned.
There won’t be much hard work on Monday, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you go, Dick?” Louise asked.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not. I’d have to cut two classes.
Besides, I’m not much good at getting around in the
crowds.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I’ll go, either,” said Lanny.</p>

<p>“Same here,” said Gordon. “You three will be
enough. The more there are the harder it will be
to agree on things.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span></p>

<p>“Now please tell us about your plan, Lanny,” said
Nell eagerly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether my plan is good for as
much as twenty-one dollars,” responded Lanny dubiously.
“I think we may be able to get, say, fifteen,
though. The reason I wouldn’t say what it was the
other night was that I had to consult others about
it first; our Head Coach, for one.”</p>

<p>“Cut out the prologue, Lanny,” advised Gordon.
“What’s the scheme?”</p>

<p>“Well, they’ve got a sort of football team across
the river called the North Side Athletics. The fellows
are mill operatives and that chap Danny Shores,
who played ball with us last Summer the time Jack
Tappen was suspended, is captain. I met him a
week or so ago at the post office and he told me about
it. Said they’d like to play us some time. I told
him I was sorry, but that our dates were all filled.
But it occurred to me the other night that the fellows
over there would pay ten or fifteen cents willingly to
see their team play the High School, and there are
a lot of them, you know. So I thought it would be
a good scheme to arrange a game with them a week
from Saturday. We go away that day to play Corwin,
you know. Saturday’s the only day they have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
to play. I saw Danny Shores yesterday and he’s
tickled to death about it. I had to tell him why we
wanted to charge admission, but he promised not to
say anything about it. They’re so crazy to play that
they don’t want any part of the gate receipts, and
Danny says we can get three or four hundred people.
What do you think of it?”</p>

<p>Morris and Gordon looked puzzled, and the latter
asked: “But how the dickens can we play Danny’s
team here if we’re going away to play Corwin the
same afternoon?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I meant to explain that we’d play the Scrubs
against them; call them the High School Second
Team, you know.”</p>

<p>“I think it will be perfectly dandy!” exclaimed
Louise.</p>

<p>“I shall go and see it,” declared Nell firmly.</p>

<p>“Don’t see,” said Morris, “why you can’t get a
pretty good crowd to it. Not many of the fellows
will go with the team to Corwin, I guess, and they’ll
be glad of a chance to see a game. How much are
you going to charge, Lanny?”</p>

<p>“Dick and I thought ten cents apiece would be
enough. If we got two hundred we’d make twenty
dollars. But I don’t believe we’d get more than a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
hundred and fifty. Still, that would mean fifteen
dollars, and maybe we’ll find a way of making up
the other five.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw,” said Gordon, “there’ll be easily two
hundred there! And I think they’ll pay fifteen cents
as quick as ten.”</p>

<p>“They might,” said Dick, “but it’s best not to
take chances. Two hundred at ten cents will be better
than a hundred at fifteen, Gordie.”</p>

<p>“Bet you the North Siders will lick us,” chuckled
Gordon. “The Scrubs haven’t found themselves
yet.”</p>

<p>“They will have by a week from Saturday,” replied
Lanny. “We’re beginning scrimmaging to-morrow
with them.”</p>

<p>“I shall begin to save up my money,” said Nell
gravely. “I’ve just got to see it! Will anyone contribute
a penny, please?”</p>

<p>All the boys donated, and Nell, jingling four
pennies in her hands, pretended to be overcome with
delight.</p>

<p>“There’s a fellow named Tanner,” said Lanny,
“who has a printing press and does pretty good
work with it. I’ll see him and ask him to do some
notices for us that we can put around in the store<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
windows. I guess he will be willing to do them
for nothing under the circumstances.”</p>

<p>“I know him,” said Gordon. “He’s a particular
crony of Fudge’s. Take Fudge along with you.”</p>

<p>“Then I don’t see but that we’re all right,” said
Louise. “And we needn’t meet again until after
we’ve been to New York. I do hope you will like
what we pick out.”</p>

<p>“We’re sure to,” replied Dick. “The main thing,
though, is for Mr. Grayson to like them!”</p>

<p>“That reminds me,” announced Morris, “that
there will be a charge for carting the stuff from the
freight-house to the school. I dare say Stewart will
do it for a dollar and a half.”</p>

<p>“You don’t want to forget,” reminded Nell, “that
you may get the things cheaper than we estimated
them. I dare say we’ll have quite all the money we
need. Wouldn’t it be splendid if we did and I hadn’t
to pay my three dollars and a half after all?”</p>

<p>The others howled at that and Dick demanded his
penny back. Gordon asked where the furniture was
to be kept until they could smuggle it into the office,
and Morris explained that they were going to have
it taken to the school late in the afternoon, after Mr.
Grayson had gone, and stored in a room in the basement.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
He had arranged with the janitor for that.
“And then, the night before, Louise is going to get
the key to Mr. Grayson’s room and we’re going to
move the old furniture out into the hall and put the
new things in.”</p>

<p>“I shall be very busy at home that evening,” murmured
Gordon.</p>

<p>Louise regarded him indignantly. “Indeed you’ll
not, Gordon Merrick! Every one has got to help.
Some of the things will be frightfully heavy.”</p>

<p>“The janitor is going to help us,” said Morris.</p>

<p>“As near as I can make out,” remarked Dick, with
a smile, “almost every one in town has been taken
into the secret except Mr. Grayson. If he doesn’t
know of it already it’s a miracle!”</p>

<p>“We had to tell the janitor,” said Morris. “And
Miss Turner. She’s going to borrow his key for us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not objecting,” replied Dick. “But
you’ll have to acknowledge that the chances of keeping
it from Mr. Grayson until the twenty-fifth are
mighty slim.”</p>

<p>“Anyway, I’m pretty sure he hasn’t heard anything
yet,” said Louise. “And—and I don’t believe
he will. It would be too frightfully mean if anyone
told him!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span></p>

<p>“Isn’t it—isn’t it getting rather late?” asked
Lanny blandly.</p>

<p>“He’s hinting for refreshments,” said Louise
scornfully. “I believe he only comes to the meetings
for that. Anyway, he won’t like the lemonade because
it isn’t hot.”</p>

<p>“The weather has moderated so much since I
made that unlucky remark that cold lemonade is
quite satisfactory,” answered Lanny. “And I <em>do</em>
hope you have some more of that cake with the underdone
frosting. It lasted me all the way home
Monday night, Louise. I even found some on my
shoes in the morning!”</p>

<p>“You’re horribly insulting,” his hostess laughed.
“I made that cake myself, Lanny, and you ought to
have raved about it!”</p>

<p>“I did—when I found it on my shoes,” drawled
Lanny.</p>

<small>FOOTBALL PROBLEMS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The next day Dick appointed three assistant
coaches. Bert Cable was to coach the linemen,
Lanny the backs and Morris the kickers.
Dick took the ends under his immediate charge.
There were now five candidates for the end positions:
Harry Bryan, Guy Felker, Jack Toll, Jim
Grover and Gordon Merrick. Dick had very distinct
ideas on the subject of end play and was fortunately
able to convey them understandingly to the candidates.
Gordon did not at once take kindly to the new
position nor show any great aptitude for the duties
involved. Except that he was quick and fast on his
feet, was physically well built for an end and had
a lot of sound sense, he was doubtless no more promising
than half a dozen others whom Dick might
have selected for the training. But Dick’s theory<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
that it was easier to make an intelligent fellow into a
football player than to make a football player intelligent
continued to guide his plans, and already he
was succeeding in vindicating that theory.</p>

<p>Among the boys who had responded to the later
call for candidates was a fifteen-year-old sophomore
named Perry Hull. Perry had never tried for the
team before and knew about as little football as it
was possible to know and live in a community where
it was played every Fall. But he was a bright-looking,
quick-acting chap, with steady dark eyes
and a firm mouth and chin, and he wasn’t afraid
of either hard knocks or hard work. When he reported
he expressed complete indifference as to
where he played, therein being much unlike the
general run of candidates, most of whom demanded
to be made into backs or ends. They told a story on
Fudge Shaw which may not have been quite truthful,
but in any case illustrates the point. Fudge, so
the story went, reported for football in his sophomore
year and, on being asked by Coach Farrell
what position he was after, replied, “Oh, captain or
quarterback, I guess!”</p>

<p>Dick liked Perry Hull’s looks at once and watched
him carefully for a week. His lack of size was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
against him as a lineman and, in fact, left few positions
open to him. He might have developed into
a satisfactory substitute end had not Dick been
quietly looking for a quarterback with more powers
of initiative than Orson Kirke showed. Kirke was
a good handler of the ball, was rather clever at gaining
in a broken field and could follow directions implicitly.
But, left to himself, he never knew what
to do and was liable to make the most stupid blunders
in the matter of choosing plays. He had been third-string
quarter the year before and had been used
only when both Putnam, the regular quarter, and
Cottrell, the first substitute, were unable to play.
Dick didn’t fancy Kirke as the sole proxy in the
Springdale game and seized on Perry Hull eagerly
as soon as he had sized up that youth. Hull was
placed in the hands of Chester Cottrell for development
and inside of a few days had proved Dick’s
acumen. Already, on the eve of the Logan contest,
Hull was the logical candidate for first substitute
quarterback, and Orson Kirke, who had theretofore
looked on himself as certain incumbent of that position,
was ruefully doing his best to outpace the
usurper. Just now Kirke might be said to be still
a full lap behind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span></p>

<p>Dick’s ability to connect player and position was
in a way remarkable. His sleight-of-hand trick in
making Guy Felker, who had been playing fullback
for two years, into a competent end was still marveled
at, and his elevation of Partridge from the
Scrub to the First Squad had been equally successful.
And now the school was watching with almost
breathless interest his experiment of molding a finished
quarterback from the raw material. In fact,
the school found a good deal to wonder at that Fall
with regard to Dick. The Norrisville game had
proved pretty conclusively, fellows considered, that
they had made no mistake in their choice of a coach.
Those who had openly scoffed were now either silent
or frankly admiring, while those who had hailed
Dick’s advent from the first were now noisily triumphant.
The question one heard on every hand
was “How does Lovering know so much football
when he has never played it and never had anything
to do with it?”</p>

<p>Dick could have told them had he chosen to. All
his life he had been forced to sit by and watch other
boys do things; play baseball and football and tennis,
run races, leap hurdles, skate and enjoy all the other
sports from which he was debarred by reason of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
weak spine. But Dick had not been content to
merely look on and envy. He had studied while he
watched, often, for his own amusement, imagining
himself in the place of some more fortunate youth
and telling himself just what he would do in such
a case. To that end Dick read up on all the sports
until, theoretically at least, he knew more about them
by half than most of the fellows who participated.
No one followed the baseball and football and track
teams more closely than Dick. He seldom missed
a contest. And, while others were content to observe
results, Dick had to know the reasons for them.
Many were the football problems he had worked out
at home with a checkerboard and checkers, or with
matches on a table-top, and many the imaginary
games he had captained. Dick, in short, was a self-taught
athlete, a book-learning one. But that book-learning
and self-instruction may produce results
had already been proved in the Summer, when he
had piloted the baseball nine to many victories, and
was now in a fair way to being proved again.</p>

<p>Dick didn’t know it all, however. No fellow who
has never actually played as well as studied can possess
an all-around knowledge of the game. Dick
was ignorant, for instance, of certain niceties of line-play,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
tricks that are second nature to a seasoned
guard or tackle or center, but, realizing his ignorance,
he didn’t pretend knowledge. Quite frankly
he asked information, solicited advice, even from the
boys he was coaching. When he made a mistake he
acknowledged the fact. One day when he was
watching Squad A practice against Squad B, and
Chester Cottrell had sent a split-tandem play at the
opposing line for a loss of several yards, Dick found
fault.</p>

<p>“You were wrong, Tupper,” he said. “You
should have put out your man and let Captain White
clear up the hole. Try that again, Cottrell.”</p>

<p>Cottrell, on the impulse, started to answer sharply.
“No, he shouldn’t, Coach! That play—” Then
he stopped as quickly, clapped his hands and cried,
“A Formation! Signals!” The others, returning
to their places, were silent, Lanny casting a doubtful
look at Dick as he fell in behind George Tupper
again. Dick, however, had read the signs.</p>

<p>“One moment,” he said. “Am I wrong, Captain
White?”</p>

<p>“I think you are,” replied Lanny frankly. “That
play sends fullback against tackle, with the ball.
Tupper’s play is to engage the center and fake an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
attack on that position. If he goes in too hard and
puts his man out too quick he doesn’t give Beaton
time to get through tackle. Same way with me,
Coach. I’m supposed to draw guard in away from
the play. If I smash in too hard and fast——”</p>

<p>“You’re right,” agreed Dick. “That was my mistake.
We’ll try that again later when they’re not
looking for it and see why it doesn’t go. All right,
Cottrell!”</p>

<p>One or two of the linemen started to grin, but almost
instantly changed their minds. A coach who
could make a mistake and own up to it as frankly
as that wasn’t a subject for ridicule! Farrell
wouldn’t have done it, they reflected. When Farrell
made an error, and he sometimes did, for all his experience,
he bullied them into a sort of half-belief
that he had been right!</p>

<p>On Thursday Squad B became officially the Scrub
Team and lined up against the First, or Varsity,
as the fellows liked to call it, for the first real scrimmage.
Tom Nostrand was captain and the roster
consisted of Jones, left end, Mander, left tackle,
Gage, left guard, Shaw, center, Nostrand, right
guard, Peyton, right tackle, Smith, right end, Farrar,
quarterback, Burns, left halfback, Sawin, right<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
halfback, and Brimmer, fullback. Six other youths
were retained as substitutes and the balance of the
candidates, eight in number, were dropped. Fudge
Shaw had not shown enough promise to warrant his
retention on the Varsity and had been released to
Nostrand and tried as center, in which position he
was doing very well. For his part, Fudge was quite
satisfied, for his ambition had never really gone beyond
a place on the Scrub Team. It is doubtful,
though, if Gage and Brimmer, both of whom had
played with the First Team prior to Dick’s advent,
were as well pleased! However, it was well understood
that changes were still likely to occur and that
any fellow who proved his right to a place on the
Varsity would get it, a knowledge which served to
cause the Scrub Team players to do their best.</p>

<p>Tom Nostrand’s warriors showed up remarkably
well that afternoon and gave the Varsity a first-class
argument. The best the latter could do was make
a touchdown in each half of twenty minutes and
hold the enemy scoreless. The Scrubs trotted from
the field not a little proud of themselves and with
Dick’s commendation, “Good work, Scrub!” ringing
in their ears. Tom Nostrand had already announced
to them that they were to play the North Side<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
team on the twenty-first, and they were more than
pleased.</p>

<p>On Friday the Varsity, contrary to custom, was
put through as hard if not harder practice than
usual, and a full hour was spent in going over the
few plays to be used against Logan the next day.
Also, there was an extremely strenuous session with
the dummy, and, after scrimmage was over, the
backs and centers were kept until it was too dark
to see, the centers passing to punters and the other
backs running down under kicks. Morris Brent
practiced goals from the field and managed to score
about six out of ten, which, as some of the angles
were extreme, was a creditable performance.</p>

<p>Morris was something of a problem to Dick and
Lanny. In spite of the doctor’s permission, Dick
had a feeling that Morris, if allowed to play as much
as he wanted to, was likely to peg out before the
big game. Lanny, too, shared this belief, and, while
neither of them could have given satisfactory reasons
for it, they were agreed that the wise course was to
nurse Morris along, giving him only enough work
to keep him in condition, and bank all on his ability
to reach the Springdale contest in top-form. Meanwhile
Lanny himself was doing most of the punting,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
Chester Cottrell supplying short kicks from regular
formation. So far Morris Brent had been brought
into the game whenever a goal from field was necessary,
but Dick was anxious to find another player
who could also be relied on to add an occasional
three points in that manner. So far, though, no
one had shown much promise. Tupper and Nelson
Beaton were doing their best under Morris’s tuition,
but they didn’t seem to get on very fast. Dick heartily
wished that he knew more about drop-kicking
himself, or, better still, that there was somebody he
could call on to come out and coach in that department
of the game.</p>

<p>And in the meantime came the game with Logan,
which, since it must be played without Lanny and
Cottrell, presented another problem!</p>

<small>“SPY!”</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Springdale lies nestled amongst the hills
six miles inland from Clearfield, and one may
make the journey speedily enough by either
steam railroad or trolley line. Lanny and Chester
chose the latter route, and after an early dinner on
Saturday, climbed into a front seat of one of the
big, lumbersome cars and settled themselves for the
forty-minute trip. Chester—he was a sturdily-built
chap of seventeen with a pleasant countenance and
a singularly attractive voice—was supplementing his
hasty meal with peanuts. Lanny declined the delicacy
and intimated that the quarterback would be a
whole lot better off if he didn’t eat such “truck” between
meals. Lanny was inclined to be irritable to-day,
recognizing which fact, Chester diplomatically
confined his entire attention to the contents of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
paper bag while the car rumbled over the B Street
Bridge after slowly and noisily trundling its way
through most of the business portion of the town.
By the time it had left the mills behind and had
plunged into the country—it sped across fields and
through woods with no heed to the highways—Lanny
was ready to talk. Perhaps the crisp October
breeze had blown his irritability away. At all
events, after that they chatted pleasantly enough and
watched the long line of shining rails rush toward
them at breath-taking speed. Every few minutes
the car slowed down at a tiny station and folks got
off or on, and the two boys, now being in excellent
spirits, viewed and discussed them and whimsically
invented histories and careers for them. The big
car pulled into Central Square in Springdale right
on time and the visitors had nearly an hour in which
to see the town and walk out to the High School
athletic field. Springdale is less citified than Clearfield,
even though it has a slightly larger population.
Perhaps the fact that it is on the main line of the railroad
and so nearer the city in point of time accounts
for its popularity as a residence town. The State
Agricultural Experiment Station lies just outside,
and Chester, who was an enthusiastic chicken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
fancier, was all for going out there to see the poultry
farm. But there was hardly time for that excursion,
and so they contented themselves with wandering
about the streets of the business section for half
an hour, quenching their thirst at a soda fountain,
standing for several minutes in front of the gaudy
placards outside a moving-picture theater, and all
the time pretending amused contempt for Springdale’s
village aspect. Then it behooved them to
reach the field and they tore themselves away from
the interesting display in a picture-dealer’s window
and moved out Maple Boulevard, their feet rustling
through the fallen leaves that almost hid the sidewalk.
They were soon part of a straggling procession
of boys and girls and older folks all headed
toward the athletic field. A number of merry-faced
youths in striped brown-and-white uniforms rode
past, and the throngs on the sidewalks waved their
blue pennants with the white S’s and shouted laughing
comments after the visitors.</p>

<p>Lanny and Chester yielded their quarters and,
being early, found places near the center of the field
in the comfortable and commodious new grandstand.
“This,” said Lanny enviously, “is what we
ought to have.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span></p>

<p>“We will some day,” replied Chester. “It’s a
peach of a stand, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes. How many do you suppose it holds? Five
hundred?”</p>

<p>“Five hundred!” exclaimed Chester. “Nearer a
thousand, I’ll bet!”</p>

<p>“It’s all very fine being presented with an athletic
field,” said Lanny, “but it’s going to keep us
poor. There’s taxes to pay on it, and they’re big,
too. That’s the trouble with having your field right
in town like ours is. Then we need a new fence all
around and a new stand. We ought to have two
stands, one back of the plate for baseball and one
beyond first base for football. The committee said
the reason they didn’t want to pay a coach this Fall
was so they could fix the field up, but I haven’t
seen them doing anything yet. There’s Weston
coming on. What sort of a team have they got,
Chester?”</p>

<p>“I guess it’s not much. They look pretty spry,
though. Say, that was some punt, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>The stand was beginning to fill and they had to
edge along to make room for a party of boys whose
conversation, overheard by the visitors, indicated
that they were Springdale High School students.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
Once Lanny intercepted an inquiring look aimed at
him by one of the group and for the first time experienced
an uncomfortable realization of his role. After
all, when he came to consider it, there was something
sort of underhand about what he and Chester were
doing, or, at any rate, it seemed so to him at that
moment. He glanced at his companion and found
Chester staring frowningly at the squad of brown-and-white
players who were trotting past in signal
practice. Perhaps feeling Lanny’s eyes on him, he
turned.</p>

<p>“I’m not crazy about this business,” he growled.
“It’s a bit too sneaky.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” replied Lanny in low tones, as anxious
to persuade himself as Chester, “we’ve got a
perfect right to come here and see these chaps play
if we want to, same as anyone else has.”</p>

<p>“Just the same,” responded the other stubbornly,
“I don’t like it. Next time Dick may send someone
else. I don’t like being a spy.”</p>

<p>“You’re not,” returned Lanny half-heartedly,
“you’re a scout.”</p>

<p>“Same thing,” Chester growled. “And for goodness
sake don’t say anything to let on, Lanny.
Those fellows next to you have been staring and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
whispering at a great rate. Bet you they suspect!”</p>

<p>“Let them!” said Lanny. “We’re not doing anything,
I tell you. They do the same thing themselves.
Didn’t they send scouts over to watch us
last year when we played Corwin or Benton?”</p>

<p>“I dare say they did. Just the same——”</p>

<p>“If you say that again I’ll chuck you off the
stand,” exploded Lanny in sudden irritation. “If
you’re so touchy you’d better go home and let me
do this.”</p>

<p>“If I was half as touchy as you are I’d jump in
the river!” retorted Chester peevishly. “If you think
I’m going to make notes with those fellows watching
you’re mistaken. Bet you every one of them knows
who we are!”</p>

<p>“Oh, get out! Why should they?”</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t they, you mean. They’ve seen
you play, haven’t they? And me, too. Even if they
don’t recognize me you needn’t think you can get
by with that white thatch of yours!”</p>

<p>“Well, what’s the difference? You don’t expect
me to dye my hair and wear false whiskers, do you,
you idiot?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t, but stop whispering, for goodness
sake, and don’t act like a conspirator! We’re giving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
the snap away as fast as we can talk. Talk out
loud.” And, suiting action to word, Chester began
to discuss the weather with startling enthusiasm and
vociferation, and kept it up until Lanny dug an
elbow into his ribs and begged him to “cut it out,
for the love of mud!” And that minute the Springdale
team trotted on the field and a boy at the foot
of the stand led a weak cheer. Evidently Springdale
was too sure of the game to display much enthusiasm.
Lanny and Chester gave their attention
to the blue-stockinged players who had taken possession
of the farther end of the field and, divided
into two squads, were going through signals and
practicing punts and field-goals.</p>

<p>“Recognize any of them?” asked Lanny.</p>

<p>Chester shook his head doubtfully. “Some of
them look familiar, but I don’t remember their
names.”</p>

<p>“That’s the same quarter they had last year. I
think his name is Kelly.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I remember him. And the tall end on the
further squad. He was on last year’s eleven. That’s
a good punt, Lanny; forty-five yards, easy. I wonder
who that chap is.”</p>

<p>“The little fellow hasn’t made but one goal so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
far,” said Lanny. “He’s had about five tries. There
goes another, from the thirty. They ought to be
pretty evenly matched at punting. What was the
name of that center they had? Hill? That’s he
coming this way; the fellow over there with the
new trousers.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t Hill, though; it was—Heath, wasn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“That’s it, Heath. I’d like to know how many
of last year’s fellows they’ve really got.”</p>

<p>“The paper said six, didn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but some of those were subs last year. Get
on to the referee with the swell sweater! Lavender
and yellow! That’s a peach of a combination,
what?”</p>

<p>The players trotted off and, after the usual preliminaries,
the teams faced each other and the game
began. From the first Weston, which was a much
lighter team, played a wide-open game and strove
to outspeed her opponent. The first quarter proved
unexpectedly exciting, for Springdale was by no
means prepared for the sort of plays Weston introduced,
and she was caught napping time and again.
But Weston always lacked the final punch necessary
to score, and the teams changed places with the honors<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
belonging to the visitors. In the second quarter
the Blue met the adversary’s attacks better, and,
securing the ball, began a march down the field that
ultimately took the pigskin to the ten-yard line.
There, however, an attack on center was stopped
and a skin-tackle play fared no better, and Kelly,
the Springdale quarter, tossed a forward pass to the
tall end whom Chester had recognized. But that
youth, having made a perfect catch, fumbled the
instant he was tackled and one of the brown-stockinged
visitors fell on the ball. A long and high
punt sent the pigskin to midfield after two downs
had failed to advance it, and Springdale, in fourteen
plays, craftily mixing line-plunges with wide end-runs
and three forward passes, all of which were
completed, soon pushed her left half over for a
touchdown. No goal resulted and, with the score
6 to 0, the half ended soon after.</p>

<p>Lanny looked questioningly at Chester as the
blanketed warriors left the field. “A dandy attack
and no defense worth speaking of,” was Chester’s
verdict.</p>

<p>Lanny nodded. “It’s early for a perfect defense,”
he replied. “They’ve got team-play, though, all
right. They’re two or three weeks ahead of us on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
that. If we were to meet them next week they’d lick
us about twenty to nothing.”</p>

<p>“Easy,” agreed Chester. “But we aren’t. And I’ll
trust Dick to bring us around in plenty of time.”</p>

<p>“You really think he’s doing pretty well, do you?”
asked Lanny anxiously.</p>

<p>“Dick? I certainly do! Don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Y-yes, only sometimes it seems to me that he’s
a little too—too cautious—or something. We’re
getting along awfully slowly, Chester.”</p>

<p>“Slow and sure,” replied the quarterback untroubledly.
“These chaps will be in top-shape long
before our game, if they don’t watch out. What do
you think of that forward-pass formation of theirs?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. It worked well enough, but it
doesn’t seem to me that sending three or four men
down the field that way to protect the catcher is a
good scheme. It shows where the pass is going, in
the first place, and gives the other fellow a chance to
get there. Seems to me Weston’s scheme, which is
about like ours, has it beat. I mean sending three
or four men to different parts of the field and so
keeping the other chaps guessing.”</p>

<p>“It worked pretty well, though,” mused Chester.</p>

<p>“Against a lighter team, yes. We could break<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
it up without much trouble, I’ll bet. It stands to
reason that if you see a bunch of fellows getting
together——”</p>

<p>“Suppose, though, Springdale sent another man
to another place and threw to him instead?”</p>

<p>“Hm; well, that might go once. It would depend
altogether on what sort of a defense the other
team put up. Of course, if you’re going to let a
man go down the field uncovered there’s bound to
be trouble.”</p>

<p>“Did you notice the lateral pass Weston got off
in the first quarter? It would have been a dandy
if the runner had got away with the ball!”</p>

<p>“Yes, but he didn’t. I don’t believe those laterals
are going to be what they’re cracked up to be,
Chester. They give the other team a lot of time to
size up the situation and meet it. If you could pull
them off quick, before the other fellows could guess
them, they’d be fine. Dick has the right idea, I
guess, when he claims that’s the only way to work
them——”</p>

<p>“Not so loud!” cautioned Chester. “Those chaps
next to you are trying to listen.” Just then one of
the chaps in question left his seat and sauntered
down the aisle. Chester watched him suspiciously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
until he was lost in the gathering that filled the space
between grandstand and field.</p>

<p>“So far I don’t think we’ve learned a great deal,”
said Lanny thoughtfully. “That fullback of theirs is
a good one and, in fact, their whole backfield works
together finely and has a good deal of punch. And
Kelly looks to me like a pretty nifty little quarter.
But their line hasn’t shown much. The left side is
weak. Look at the way Weston got through tackle
there half a dozen times.”</p>

<p>“They certainly haven’t shown anything startlingly
new, unless it’s that forward pass dodge of
theirs. They use the same five-men-in-line formation
on defense they used last year. I noticed,
though, that they pass direct to the runner a good
deal.”</p>

<p>“There’s nothing new in that,” said Lanny.
“Here they come again. I’d like to see Weston get
one over on them. I wonder if they’ve got a man
who can kick field-goals.”</p>

<p>“If they have they ought to have used him last
time,” replied the other. “They had a fine chance
when they were on Springdale’s ten and couldn’t get
through.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they wanted a touchdown.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p>“Maybe, but Farrell used to say ‘Hit first!’ and
it’s a good scheme, Lanny. If Weston had got
three points then you don’t know what the effect on
Springdale would have been.”</p>

<p>“She’d have played harder,” said Lanny.</p>

<p>“Yes, but playing harder doesn’t always mean
playing better,” replied Chester, with a wise shake
of his head. “I tell you, Lanny, there is a whole lot
in getting first blood. I’ve seen it win lots and lots
of times.”</p>

<p>“Look down there,” whispered Lanny suddenly.
“See those two fellows looking up? Isn’t the smaller
chap the one who went down a while ago?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Chester softly. “And he’s told
the other fellow about us and he’s recognized us.
See them talking it over.”</p>

<p>“Well, let them talk,” grunted Lanny. “They’ve
got nothing on us.”</p>

<p>“No, but I don’t like my job, just the same. There
they go. Do you suppose they’re going to look for
a cop?”</p>

<p>“I dare say. Maybe they’re going to send for the
ambulance,” replied Lanny with a grin. “Which
way did they go?”</p>

<p>“I lost them. No, there they are, and— Say,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
isn’t that Newman, the coach, they’re talking to?”</p>

<p>“Where? Yes, by Jove, it is! He’s looking up
here now!”</p>

<p>“Put your head down! Don’t let him see that
white thatch of yours, Lanny!”</p>

<p>“I will not!” declared Lanny defiantly. “I’m not
doing anything I’m ashamed of!”</p>

<p>“I suppose not,” muttered Chester, “only, just the
same, I sort of feel as if I were!”</p>

<p>“Buck up!” chuckled Lanny. “Here comes the
Smart Aleck who went down to tell. Now watch
the excitement when the glad news gets out!”</p>

<p>The boy in question pushed his way back to his
seat and his companions leaned eagerly toward him.
But, although Lanny and Chester frankly listened,
they could hear only low whispering and, finally,
chuckles. Lanny frowned.</p>

<p>“What are they choking about?” he asked. “They
evidently think they’ve got a great joke on us.”</p>

<p>“Probably think we don’t know they’re on to us.
There goes the kick-off.”</p>

<p>Lanny, however, was stealing a look toward his
neighbors and was puzzled to find them all observing
him with amusement. The boy next to him but
one nodded impudently as he met Lanny’s gaze.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
“How’s everything in Clearfield?” he inquired politely.</p>

<p>“Fine, thanks,” replied Lanny gravely. Chester
turned an anxious countenance.</p>

<p>“Came over to see a real football team, I suppose,”
continued the Springdale youth with a grin.</p>

<p>Lanny nodded. “Yes, and I’m still looking for it,”
he answered.</p>

<p>“Keep right on looking,” another boy chuckled.
“You won’t see much to-day, old top.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t so far. You fellows are playing your
Scrubs, I see.”</p>

<p>“Shut up, Lanny,” whispered Chester.</p>

<p>“Yes, we are,” was the reply from the adversary.
“We’re giving them a little work so as to get them
in shape for Clearfield. No use using the regulars
in that game, you know!”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” returned Lanny cheerfully. “Put
your strongest team in the field. You’ll need it!”</p>

<p>“We can beat you with the girl’s basket-ball team,”
was the scathing retort. But Lanny, hearkening to
Chester’s entreaties, turned away without response,
and the neighbors contented themselves for the rest
of the game with talking at instead of to them.</p>

<p>It was soon made clear to the two scouts why the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
boys at the other end of the seat were amused. For
the rest of that half, Springdale used only the most
ordinary, old-fashioned football. It was quite plain
that the Springdale coach, either because he feared
the two visitors might really learn something of use
to them, or because he wanted to have a joke on
them, had instructed the team to show nothing.
Lanny and Chester exchanged amused glances when,
on Weston’s twenty-yard line, with four to go on
fourth down, Springdale chose to lose possession of
the ball by a hopeless plunge at guard rather than
make her distance by a trick play or even try for
a field-goal. In the last quarter Springdale was hard
pressed to keep her goal line from being crossed, for
Weston, using every play in her programme, got as
far as the six yards and might have gone over if,
in her eagerness to score, she had not fumbled on the
threshold. The game ended soon after that, the
figures on the board unchanged, and Weston, possibly
puzzled by her adversary’s strange choice of
plays in the last half, but evidently well pleased at
the outcome, trotted off with the airs of a victor,
while a small group of supporters at the far end of
the stand waved brown-and-white banners and
cheered proudly!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span></p>

<p>When Lanny and Chester arose to leave they
found that their neighbors in the row were waiting
for them to pass out ahead. With a slight frown,
Lanny led the way, crowding past the youths, and
Chester followed silently. As they passed, the enemy
indulged in pointed remarks to each other.
“Seen any spies about to-day, Hal?” “I thought
I saw a couple of the things.” “Guess they didn’t
learn much, eh?” “No, it’s a poor day for spies.”
“Too bad to come all that way for nothing!” “Yes,
isn’t it? Poor chaps, I’m sorry for them!”</p>

<p>Lanny only smiled untroubledly, and Chester,
trying to look quite as if he heard nothing, gazed
intently at the back of Lanny’s head. But when he
was squeezing his way past the last boy in the row
a foot went out and Chester, stumbling, had to catch
Lanny’s shoulder to keep from falling. Instantly
he turned and confronted the grinning face beside
him.</p>

<p>“Don’t do that,” he said quietly, “or you’ll get
hurt.”</p>

<p>There was something in Chester’s countenance
that silenced the retort on the Springdale youth’s
lips, and it was not until Lanny and Chester were
in the aisle and on their way down that the fellow’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
courage returned. Then, raising his voice, he called:</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t hurt anyone, you Clearfield spy!”</p>

<p>A jeer from the others accompanied the taunt, but
Chester kept straight ahead. He was thoroughly
angry inside, but he knew that it would never do to
accept that challenge. Chester was no coward, but
he realized that it would look rather disgraceful for
a member of the Clearfield team to visit Springdale
as a scout and then get into a fracas! All the way
down the stand, and, indeed, until they were well
back into the town, they were uncomfortably conscious
of the curious, amused, often unfriendly regard
of the Springdale fellows, and more than once
the word “Spy!” reached them as, striving to converse
unconcernedly, they followed the returning
throng toward the town.</p>

<p>But eventually they found themselves alone, and
Lanny heaved a sigh of relief. “I wouldn’t do that
again for a thousand dollars!” he said emphatically.</p>

<p>“And I wouldn’t do it for ten thousand,” replied
Chester. “The next time Dick wants any dirty work
like that done he may do it himself! The worst
of it was we couldn’t fight!”</p>

<p>“Which,” replied Lanny dryly as they boarded a
car, “was lucky for us!”</p>

<small>THE BOARD OF STRATEGY</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“Home again from a foreign shore,” murmured
Lanny as they climbed down from
the car in the Square. “I wonder how the
game came out. Bet you we got licked, Chester.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe so. We’ll ask somebody.” He
looked about him but caught sight of no one he
knew. “There’ll be some of the fellows in Castle’s,
I guess. Come on in. Want a soda?”</p>

<p>“No, thanks. I must be getting home. I’ll call
up Gordon on the ’phone and find out. Will you
be around at Dick’s after supper?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Wait a minute, Lanny! There’s Fudge
Shaw in there. He’ll know about the game.”</p>

<p>Lanny, who had started toward the crossing on his
way home, rejoined Chester and together they
pushed through the crowd at the doorway of the popular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
drug store. At the right, in a corner which held
a cushioned settee and two or three small wire-legged
tables, sat Fudge. An emaciated rubber
plant hung its leaves above his head, a tall glass of
ice-cream soda was in one hand and a dripping
spoon in the other, and his eyes were fixed ecstatically
on the big glass jar which, suspended in the
nearer window, glowed with carmine and purple.</p>

<p>“It’s a shame to wake him,” chuckled Chester, as
they wormed their way through the throng. “What
an awful looking mess he’s eating!”</p>

<p>“How did the game come out, Fudge?” demanded
Lanny anxiously.</p>

<p>Fudge’s rapt gaze fell slowly away from the
hypnotic brilliancy. “Eh?” he murmured.</p>

<p>Lanny impatiently repeated the question, while
Fudge blinked and brought his thoughts back with
an evident effort.</p>

<p>“Hello, fellows! Game? Oh, they beat us.
Thirteen to seven.”</p>

<p>“What do you know about that?” demanded
Lanny disgustedly. “Isn’t that the dickens?”</p>

<p>“How did they do it, Fudge?” asked Chester.</p>

<p>“Made two touchdowns to our one,” replied
Fudge, dipping his spoon in the harlequin concoction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
and conveying a liberal portion of it to his
mouth.</p>

<p>“Oh, cut out the comedy,” said Lanny. “What
was the matter with our team?”</p>

<p>“Search me,” replied Fudge, in an injured tone.
“We just couldn’t get started, it seemed. Logan
scored in the first period and the second, and we
didn’t do anything until about five minutes before
the end of the game. Then that fellow Hull shot a
forward off to Gordon and Gordie got away with
it for about thirty yards. After that they couldn’t
stop us and Nelson Beaton went over for the touchdown.”</p>

<p>“What sort of a game did Logan play?” asked
Lanny, plainly disconsolate.</p>

<p>“Fine! They had a grand time running around
our ends, or they did until Dick put Gordon Merrick
in for Felker. Felker was rotten to-day on
defense. Gee, but Gordie played a great little game
after he got in! And, say, Lanny, that fellow Hull
is a wonder! You ought to have seen the way he
fooled those fellows on quarterback runs! It was
fine!”</p>

<p>“It must have been if we got licked like that!”
said Lanny. “Was McCoy good?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span></p>

<p>“I guess so. Pretty fair. We didn’t seem able
to stop them outside of tackles, though. That right
half of theirs made a seventy-yard run one time.
That was when they got their first touchdown.
They fooled us on a fake-kick play and sent a back
around Felker’s end from our fifteen yards.”</p>

<p>“I knew we’d get licked,” muttered Lanny. “We
must have played a solid-ivory sort of game,
Chester!”</p>

<p>“You ought to hear the fellows roasting the team
afterwards,” chuckled Fudge, struggling with another
spoonful of ice-cream. “Dick, too. They say
he didn’t more than half try to win. He put in six
subs in the last half. What sort of a way is that?”</p>

<p>“I take it you didn’t get in,” said Chester, sarcastically.</p>

<p>“I’m on the Scrub,” replied Fudge, untroubledly.
“Bet you I could have done as well as Thad Brimmer
did, though. How was the Springdale game,
Lanny?”</p>

<p>“Pretty good,” Lanny replied absently. “Six to
nothing, Springdale. Well, I must be getting on.
See you later, Chester.”</p>

<p>Chester nodded and Lanny went out. “He feels
pretty bad about it, I guess,” said Chester.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span></p>

<p>“He’d have felt worse if he’d been here and
seen it,” replied Fudge, philosophically. “It was
p, u, n, k, punk!”</p>

<p>“Say, for goodness sake, what sort of a mess is
that you’re eating?” asked Chester, his curiosity at
last demanding satisfaction.</p>

<p>“This?” asked Fudge, stirring his spoon about in
the glass and watching the resultant blending of
colors with admiring eyes. “This is what I call an
Opalescent Dream.”</p>

<p>“Looks more like a nightmare! What’s in it?”</p>

<p>“Strawberry and chocolate and lemon ice-cream
and blood-orange sirup. You take a third of each
and——”</p>

<p>But Chester, with a gesture eloquent of repugnance,
had flown. Fudge smiled calmly and stirred
again with still more interesting results. “Some
folks don’t know what’s good,” he murmured blissfully.</p>

<p>The Board of Strategy, as George Cotner chose
to call it, met in Dick’s parlor that evening at half-past
seven, Dick, Lanny, Cottrell and Cotner present.
Dick disposed of the afternoon’s contest with
Logan in few words.</p>

<p>“They outplayed us,” he said frankly. “Our line<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
was fully as good as theirs, I think, but their backs
were better. Besides, they had more plays and used
them well. We were handicapped by a lack of plays
and those we had didn’t fool them. They made
practically all of their gains around our tackles and
couldn’t make much impression on the line. They
got their first touchdown as the result of a fine
run by Showalter, their right half, which put the
ball on our thirteen yards. From there they took
it over in one play, around our right end. Felker
was neatly boxed and they had no trouble. Their
next score was after they had worked our ends and
thrown a forward pass for gains that took them
from the middle of the field to our twelve yards.
They finally got through Wayland for the last half-yard.
They made twelve first downs to our seven,
I believe. We outpunted them by about five yards
on an average. Hull, who took your place, Chester,
ran the team very well and was very clever at carrying
the ball. He promises remarkably well and
ought to make a first-class quarter by next Fall.
We used six substitutes in the third and fourth
quarters. Merrick at right end showed up well and
made a clever catch of a forward pass and a thirty-yard
run that made possible our touchdown. On<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
the whole, the substitutes did good work. I’m sorry
we couldn’t have won, Lanny, but the game showed
us our weaknesses, and that’s something. Now,
what did you fellows learn at Springdale?”</p>

<p>“Mighty little,” answered Lanny. “They got on
to us and stalled all through the last half.”</p>

<p>“What about the first half?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“Weston played all around them in the first quarter.
Used a lot of queer stunts from open formation,
like double-passes back of the line, with an
end breaking through or a half running wide. The
plays weren’t much, but Springdale didn’t get on
to them for a while. In the second period she opened
her line out and dropped an extra man behind it.
That worked better. She made her score by pretty
clever work. Got off three dandy forward passes
and mixed her plays up well.”</p>

<p>“What formation did she use on attack?” asked
Dick.</p>

<p>“Same as last year. For kicking she played her
ends way out. It wasn’t a fair test, though, for
Weston is a light team and couldn’t do much with
the Springdale line. If she’d use that kicking formation
against us we could smear her every time,
I guess.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span></p>

<p>Dick continued his questions, making notes from
the information he received, and at last said, with a
smile: “On the whole, I think you chaps managed to
find out a good deal. Still, it’s pretty evident that
Springdale didn’t show anything new. She wouldn’t,
I suppose, so early in the season. We’ll see what the
Springdale paper says Monday about the game.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Dick,” said Chester, “what’s the—the
ethics of that sort of thing?”</p>

<p>“What sort of thing, Chester?”</p>

<p>“Why, scouting, as we call it; spying on the other
fellow.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Dick slowly. “I don’t
think I’ve ever considered it. Why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“Because I felt like an awful sneak over there
this afternoon,” was the answer. “So did Lanny,
only he wouldn’t own up to it.”</p>

<p>“Everyone does it,” observed George Cotner.</p>

<p>“That doesn’t make it right, though,” said Chester
doggedly. “I don’t believe it is right, either. If it
were I wouldn’t have felt so like a—a fox!”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” said Dick. “I wouldn’t have asked
you to do it if I’d known you were going to feel that
way about it.” He jabbed a pencil thoughtfully into
the tablecloth. Then, “Honestly, fellows, I don’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
know what to say about it. As George says, everyone
does it; colleges and schools everywhere. I
suppose that if we look on football as a sort of
athletic warfare—to coin a term—we have every
right to spy on the enemy in order to learn, as in
real warfare, what his condition is and what his
plans may be.”</p>

<p>“Surest thing you know!” agreed George.</p>

<p>“On the other hand, if we look at football as
merely a—a gentleman’s pastime, the spying part
is hard to defend. It’s rather a difficult question to
answer, Chester.”</p>

<p>“A football campaign,” declared George convincedly,
“is exactly like real war. We form our
army, we train it, we map out a campaign, we plan
strategies. If the enemy has weak spots in its—its
battle-line we want to know it so we can throw
the brunt of our attack there. As long as the other
fellow doesn’t hide behind fences and hold secret
practice we’ve got a perfect right to go and watch
him and learn what we can. It’s done all the time.
All the big colleges do it and I’ve never heard any
objections made before. Why, bless you, fellows,
Springdale will be over here scouting in a couple of
weeks!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span></p>

<p>“Just the same,” returned Chester, using his favorite
expression, and bringing a smile to Lanny’s
face, “no more of it for me, <em>if</em> you please!”</p>

<p>“Is that how you feel, Lanny?” Dick inquired.</p>

<p>“I guess it is, Dick. I don’t say I wouldn’t do
it again if you say it’s all fair and right, but I didn’t
like it to-day very much. For my part, I can’t see
why it should be necessary. If all the teams agreed
not to do it I suppose we’d get on just as well.
After all, it doesn’t do much good, I guess. A team
doesn’t show its real stuff until its big game. I
think we could get on without it.”</p>

<p>“I’m perfectly willing to try,” said Dick. “Somehow,
now that you mention it, it doesn’t seem quite—well,
gentlemanly. But that raises the question,
Lanny, of how far we <em>can</em> go and act like gentlemen.
Is it fair, for instance, to read about the other
team’s progress in the newspapers?”</p>

<p>“Quite, I’d say,” replied Lanny. “Seems to me
that’s different. If information gets into the papers
that’s their lookout, and anyone has a right to
read it.”</p>

<p>“If scouts get into their grandstand that’s their
business, too,” said George. “What’s the difference?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span></p>

<p>“The difference is,” answered Chester, “that they
are willing the newspaper stuff should be published,
but they aren’t willing that we should see
them play. And they can’t keep us out if we have
the money to buy tickets. You can talk your head
off, George, but I know there <em>is</em> a difference.”</p>

<p>“I can’t see it!”</p>

<p>“It’s there, just the same,” muttered Chester.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s agree that it is wrong, fellows; or,
at least, bad form, a little underhand, a little ungentlemanly.
Let’s make a rule not to do it. We’ll
play it safe, in other words.” This from Dick.</p>

<p>“That’s all right if you can get the other fellow
to cut it out too,” demurred George, “but if he
doesn’t he’s got a big advantage over us. I call
that pretty crazy business.”</p>

<p>“Oh, let’s be crazy, then,” exclaimed Lanny.
“Fair sport is fair sport, but spying isn’t! It’s
sneaky stuff! Let’s call it off.”</p>

<p>“Right-o,” agreed Chester. “And I dare say
when Springdale learns that we’ve stopped it she’ll
stop it too.”</p>

<p>“She’s not likely to believe we have stopped it,”
observed George dryly, “after seeing you two fellows
over there this afternoon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span></p>

<p>“No; but she’ll believe it after awhile,” said Dick
cheerfully. “So we’ll call that settled. Now then,
let’s see what we’ve learned to-day.” He picked
his memorandum book from the table and began
to turn the leaves. “Personally, I’m pretty well
pleased with this Logan game. It’s shown up a
whole lot of weak places, fellows, and you can’t
make repairs until you learn where the breaks are.
If we can get through the Corwin game with no
worse results we’ll be doing pretty well.”</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” groaned Lanny. “Don’t tell me
we’ve got to take another licking next week!”</p>

<p>“I hope not, but if we are licked and we get
through with no injuries, as we did to-day, and we
find out our mistakes as well as we did to-day, I’ll
be satisfied.”</p>

<p>“The school won’t,” replied Lanny glumly.
“Three defeats out of five games would be going
it pretty strong, Dick.”</p>

<p>“Fairly,” returned the coach untroubledly. “So
would being beaten by Springdale, Lanny.”</p>

<p>“Of course, but—oh, well, you know best, I dare
say,” Lanny sighed. “If it wasn’t that I happen
to be captain, Dick——”</p>

<p>“There’s a good deal of growling about to-day’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
defeat,” observed George Cotner. “Of course, fellows
always do kick when the team loses and cheer
like mad when it wins. Still, I’m inclined to think
it might be a good plan to—well, to make a little
extra effort and win next week’s game, Dick. Just
for the—er—the look of the thing, you know.”</p>

<p>“Bless the look of the thing,” said Dick placidly.
“We’ll win if we can do it without disturbing the
plan of development we’ve settled on. If we lose,
the fellows will just have to howl. What we’ve got
to do is keep our eyes on the Eighteenth of November!”</p>

<p>“You bet!” said Chester. “Who cares whether
Corwin is beaten or not? Or Benton, or Lesterville?
We want to lick Springdale! That’s what
we’re here for, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I dare say,” agreed George; “but isn’t there always
the danger of losing so many games that the
team will think it <em>can’t</em> win?”</p>

<p>“You mean it might develop the habit of defeat?”
laughed Dick. “That’s a new idea, George. I
didn’t know you were such a psychologist.”</p>

<p>“I’m not, I’m a Methodist,” retorted the manager.</p>

<p>“There may be something in your theory,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
though,” Dick continued, “and so I guess it will
be best to let them win once in awhile.” Dick’s
eyes twinkled as he turned to Lanny’s somewhat
disconsolate countenance. “Which game on the rest
of the schedule would you rather win, Lanny?”</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed the captain. “Do you mean
that—” Then he caught the gleam of laughter in
Dick’s eyes and grinned relievedly. “We’ll beat
the grads,” he said. “How’ll that do?”</p>

<p>“Finely! So let’s get busy and see where we
stand.” Dick took up his memorandum again.
“Move up here, George, and let me have those notes
of yours. That’s the ticket. Now then, starting
with the plays we used——”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br />
<small>A TRIP TO THE CITY</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">On Monday, Morris and his sister and May
Burnham made the journey to New York.
Mr. Brent had advanced to them the difference
between what had been paid in by subscribers
to the Fund and the ninety dollars at which they had
figured the purchases. They set off in fine spirits,
for the day was what Morris called a “perfect
corker,” and all were flushed with the spirit of adventure.
They had luncheon on the train, Morris
acting the part of host, and reached the Grand Central
Terminal a few minutes after they had finished.
Visits to New York were infrequent enough to make
them feel quite breathlessly excited as they followed
Morris to the street. Morris was all for getting to
the furniture store by subway, but the girls wanted
to see the sights, they declared, and refused to be
beguiled underground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span></p>

<p>“I always feel like a human mole down there,”
said Louise. “And I’m frightened half to death
besides.”</p>

<p>“And we want to see the streets and the shops
and the people,” added May. “It’s a perfect waste of
opportunity to come to New York and spend half
your time in subways, Morris!”</p>

<p>So Morris gave in with fairly good grace, grumbling
a little at the foolishness of girls, and boarded
a surface car. He made the mistake of turning eastward
instead of toward the west when they alighted
at Eighteenth Street and had to stand some joking
from his companions when the error was discovered.
Marsden’s proved to be a huge establishment occupying
a building of its own, with floor after floor
of wonderful things. For over an hour they trotted
around, in and out of elevators, up and down endless
aisles, at the heels of a most imposing gentleman
in a frock coat and immaculate gray trousers. Morris
declared afterwards that he didn’t have much
chance to see the furniture, he was all the time
admiring the creases in those trousers and wondering
whether they were starched! May, on the
other hand, confessed that she had been quite hypnotized
by the salesman’s lovely whiskers! So, if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
we believe them, Louise was the only member of the
Purchasing Committee able to give her entire attention
to the matter at hand. And Louise did, occasionally
reprimanding the others for their levity,
or begging them to please help her decide. It was,
in fact, really Louise who made the purchases, for
when the others were not exchanging whispered
jokes they were usually wandering around far from
the article in discussion.</p>

<p>It was no easy task to decide, either, for Marsden’s
showed so many styles and values that Louise
was quite at sea. But at last everything on the list
was accounted for and, to their delight, the total,
after deducting the discount, was well under the
ninety dollars. Even the filing-cabinet, which Morris
had predicted they would have to look elsewhere
for, was obtainable at Marsden’s. At the last, because
they still had several dollars left unexpended,
Louise ordered a handsome wastebasket of Japanese
woven ware, the color of which almost exactly
matched the mahogany of the other things, on her
own authority. They gave Mr. Brent’s address, obtained
the salesman’s promise to have the goods
shipped by freight not later than the next afternoon,
paid the bill and emerged triumphant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span></p>

<p>“I think we did beautifully,” exulted May as they
joined the throng on the sidewalk outside. “And
we have nearly four dollars left!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Morris, with a grin, “I think we
did pretty well myself. I don’t want to seem to be
taking too much credit, but I must say that without
my assistance in there——”</p>

<p>“<em>Your</em> assistance!” interrupted Louise almost
crossly. “You were both about as much use as—as
nothing at all! I think you acted horridly. I know
that man thought you were crazy.”</p>

<p>“He’s got nothing on me, then,” laughed Morris.
“I’m mighty sure I thought he was! Say, if the
salesmen dress the way he does, Sis, what do you
suppose Marsden himself wears? Bet you he’s covered
with purple velvet and gold lace. Gee, I’d like
to see him!”</p>

<p>For another hour or more the two girls shopped,
Morris dangling along and complaining at every
doorway. They didn’t buy much, but they had the
finest sort of a good time and, or so Morris averred,
were in such a condition of amazed and delighted
awe that their eyes very nearly popped from their
heads! And then, of a sudden, Morris, who had
been standing on first one foot and then the other,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
and who had been buffeted and pushed and squeezed
and jammed, and who was more tired than if he had
put in a hard two hours of football practice, discovered
to his joy and relief that they had just time
to reach the station to get the train home, and literally
dragged the girls from the store they were in.
But before they could reach the car-line the brilliant
windows of a famous confectioner sprang into view
and May squealed with delight and refused to go
home until she had had an ice-cream soda. After
that it was a close shave, but they eventually reached
the train before it pulled out and, thoroughly breathless
and tired, sank into their seats and viewed each
other in triumph.</p>

<p><a href="#i_170fp">“I’ve had the loveliest time,” announced Louise
exultantly</a>, “and I’m simply tired—to—death!”</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_170fp">
  <img src="images/i_170fp.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_170">“‘I’ve had the loveliest time,’ announced Louise exultantly.”</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>“Tired!” grumbled Morris. “Don’t talk to me
about being tired! I’m one big ache from head to
toes, and my feet feel as if they’d been pounded by
a spile-driver! I don’t mind <em>buying</em> things, but when
it comes to <em>shopping</em>—<em>excuse me</em>!”</p>

<p>And the odd part of it was that Morris’s tiredness
stayed with him all the next day, and when, at practice,
he tried to kick some goals in the course of his
half-hour instruction of the candidates under his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
charge, he made awful misses! The Scrubs played
the Varsity to a standstill that afternoon, and all the
driving of which Dick and Lanny were capable, and
all the entreaties of Chester Cottrell and of Perry
Hull, who took his place finally, failed to bring about
a score. The Scrubs were as proud as turkey cocks
and remained so until the next day, when, smarting
under the ignominy of those forty scoreless minutes,
the Varsity came back and literally tore the other
team wide open and scored three touchdowns, two of
which Morris converted into goals. The best that
the Scrub Team could do was to force a safety on
the Varsity when Tupper misjudged a punt.</p>

<p>That was on Wednesday. Thursday passed without
a scrimmage since Dick was not satisfied with
the tackling and handling of the ball. Several of the
Varsity had been showing the weakest sort of work
at tackling and fumbles had been far too frequent.
And so on Thursday there was a hard drill at the
dummy and a lot of work in essentials. Cable took
the linemen off to a corner of the field and gave them
a long session in blocking and breaking through, and
Morris kept his pupils busy in front of a goal. It
must be confessed that Morris was not a huge success
as an instructor. He knew how to kick goals<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
from placement and from drops, and he was a good
punter, but when it came to imparting his knowledge
to George Tupper and Nelson Beaton, he was far
less skillful. The explanation was that he didn’t
really know how he obtained his results, and if one
doesn’t know how he does a thing, it’s well-nigh impossible
to teach another! Morris took infinite
trouble, for he was fully as enthusiastic as Dick about
developing the kickers, and he worked as hard as
he knew how, but his method of correcting a pupil
was to say, “No, you don’t get it, George. Now
watch me. See? One hand on each side—get your
lacings right—sight your goal—drop it—swing—
There you are! See what I mean?” And Tupper
or Beaton would assent doubtfully and, perhaps, do
no better the next time. Still, George Tupper had
made progress; that couldn’t be denied; and Dick
hoped for the best and silently wished he knew more
about the gentle art of drop- and placement-kicking
himself.</p>

<p>On Friday the team showed some improvement
as a result of the previous day’s practice, and in the
short and not very hard scrimmage with the Scrubs
managed to get by without fumbling. But a spell
of unseasonably warm weather had had its effect on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
the players of both teams and there were distinct
signs of sluggishness visible. Dick read the signs
and called an early halt. He had been expecting
a slump for several days and now, he told himself,
it had arrived. He was relieved rather than troubled,
however, for if there must be a slump—and there
usually is at some time during a football season—it
was better to have it now than two weeks, or even
a week later. He hoped for a change of weather
on the morrow, but scarcely dared expect it.</p>

<p>And it didn’t come. If anything, Saturday was
warmer and more enervating than Friday had been,
and many of the seventeen players whom Dick took
to Corwin at noon looked dragged and tired. Not
a few more were plainly irritable, always a bad sign,
and Dick secretly feared that Lanny was not destined
to be much pleased with the outcome of the
afternoon’s game.</p>

<p>But if the Varsity was not in the best of condition,
little fault could be found with the Scrubs
that afternoon. Perhaps the prospect of having
a real game with an outside team buoyed them
up and caused them to forget the fact that they had
been listless the day before. At all events, they
trotted on to the field for the contest with the North<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
Side team looking much alive. Will Scott, who
had not been taken along to Corwin with the Varsity,
had been given the management of the Scrubs
for the occasion, which meant that he had his hands
pretty full. Not that the players demanded any
attention from him, but he had to look after the
contest itself; find boys to take money at the two
gates, see that Danny Shore’s players were looked
after on arrival, arrange for a referee, an umpire and
a head linesman, find a youth to take one end of the
ten-yard chain and perform a number of other duties,
which, since he had never performed them before,
caused him a condition of mind and body
closely approaching collapse.</p>

<p>The public turned out generously for that much-heralded
game. A large portion of the audience was
composed of workers in the factories, who were
plainly there for two things; to have a good time—and
having a good time with them entailed making
a certain amount of noise—and to see their champions
win. When the last spectator had entered and
Will Scott hurriedly counted the proceeds, he discovered
that something over three hundred and
twenty persons had paid their dimes at the gates,
which, everything considered, was a good showing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span></p>

<p>The Scrubs were playing to-day under the title
of the High School Second Team, a title which carried
more dignity and seemed better calculated to
attract an audience. Two of the Varsity substitutes
who were not taken to Corwin lent their strength
to Captain Nostrand’s team. These were Grover,
who took Jones’s place at left end, and McCoy, who
ousted Burns at left half. Fudge Shaw was at center,
a position which Fudge had been filling most
creditably.</p>

<p>So far as enthusiasm went, that game was notable.
The North Siders rooted loudly and continuously,
while the High School adherents, encouraged by the
enemy to expressions of loyalty, greeted the Second
with a hearty cheer when it appeared, and indulged
in further encouragement of a similar nature as the
game progressed. The North Siders were older
than their opponents and averaged, especially in the
line, much heavier. But their play was scarcely more
than elemental, and appeared to be built around two
very clever backs, Wightson and Larue. The first
of these was a raw-boned Welshman of about twenty,
and the second a black-haired little French Canadian
who seemed to be built of steel, and went into
the enemy like a human bullet, and was just about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
as hard to stop. Danny Shores, red-headed and
shrill-voiced, played quarterback and made up by
grim determination for what he lacked in experience
and science.</p>

<p>It was a very good game, in spite of its raggedness.
Fumbles were plentiful on both sides, and the
North Side backs continually missed the signals.
The Seconds showed an over-eagerness that lost
them more than it gained, and Pete Farrar, who
played quarter, had his hands more than full in trying
to steady them down. The High School players
got the jump on the adversary in the first few
minutes of the game, and so bewildered them by
open plays that, almost before anyone realized what
was happening, they were down on their opponents’
ten-yard line with every indication of scoring. But
an unlucky fumble spoiled their chance of a touchdown,
a fumble which red-headed Danny Shores
recovered by plunging between Fudge’s sturdy
legs.</p>

<small>AN UNWILLING HERO</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">North Side used Wightson and Larue continuously,
hurling them against the line from
tackle to tackle and managing to work the ball
from under the goal well into the middle of the field.
There, however, the Second, surmising that attacks
outside the tackles were not included in the enemy’s
present plans, concentrated its secondary defense
behind the center of its line and stopped the advance,
North Side being forced to kick. The punt was
poor and rolled out near the adversary’s forty yards,
and from there the Second began another advance.
But a fumble again lost ground and a punt went
over the goal line. On a third try from their twenty
yards, the North Siders managed to get Wightson
clear for a twelve-yard run. A minute later Larue
also squirmed free and, with the factory workers yelling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
their lungs out in the stand and along the side
lines, North Side passed the middle of the field, and
for the first time had the pigskin in High School territory.</p>

<p>They played a hard and desperate game, caring
nothing for knocks and bruises; in fact, showing a
willingness to stand any sort of punishment so long
as they gained ground. Concentrating their attack
on Gage, at left guard, they wore that youth down,
so that, finally, on the Second’s thirty-two yards,
that player was withdrawn to recover his breath and
nurse his injuries, and Johnson took his place. Johnson
was a big Senior who knew little football, but
who looked so imposing and mighty that the North
Side transferred its attentions to the other guard.
But Captain Nostrand was not so easy a proposition
as Gage had proved, and the enemy’s advance
was stopped. A desperate attempt to get a forward
pass across the goal line from the thirty yards failed,
and the twelve-minute period came to an end.</p>

<p>High School punted on second down when play
was resumed and Grover recovered the ball after
a fumble by Quarterback Shores on the North Siders’
thirty-yard line. From there, in eleven plays,
mixing forward passes with fake-kicks and end<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
runs, High School scored, sending McCoy through
right tackle for two yards and a touchdown. Brimmer,
who essayed to kick the goal, failed by a narrow
margin.</p>

<p>There was no more scoring in that half, although
the North Siders were threatening High School’s
goal when the whistle blew. Undismayed, the audience
from across the river consumed peanuts and
popcorn and enjoyed themselves noisily. Nostrand
returned Gage to the line when play began again and
put Burns in for Sawin at right half. Getting the
pigskin on the kick-off, North Side, with one or two
substitutes in her line, returned to her line-bucking
tactics, evidently resolved to tire out and wear down
the High School defense. Wightson was the marvel
of that contest. How he could perform the work
that was given to him and keep on his feet, no one
understood. He was always good for a short gain
and seldom failed to get clear of the first defense.
Only the fine work of McCoy and Burns, the latter
returned to the backfield on account of his defensive
ability, saved the day time after time, for, once free,
the big Welshman could never have been stopped.
Pete Farrar, with his one hundred and forty-odd
pounds, would have been tossed aside like a chip<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
had he ever been called on to get between Wightson
and the goal line! Now and then, but infrequently
during the first three periods, Larue was called on,
but for the most part it was the Welshman who took
the ball and banged himself, head down, against the
opposing line, much as an enraged bull might have
assaulted a stone wall. High School was fortunate
in being able to know beforehand pretty well where
the attack was coming, since Danny Shores had but
few plays and those were not difficult to guess, and
so was able to put her backfield defenses where it
would do the most good. But for all of that, their
line was showing wear and tear before that third
quarter was over. North Side did not deliberately
“mix it up,” and only one penalty was meted out
to her because of unnecessary roughness, but her
savage and desperate attacks were bound to tell.
Fudge was wearing a bloody nose, which gave him
a most disreputable appearance, and several other
linemen showed marks of battle when the third
quarter ended.</p>

<p>By that time the North Side supporters had become
impatient and were howling for a touchdown,
calling on the players individually to distinguish
themselves. “Get into ’em, Billy! What you scared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
of?” “Eat ’em up, Pat! Show us what you know!”
“Give us a touchdown now! Are you goin’ to let
’em lick yer?” “Where’s yer fight, Terry? Kill
’em, boy, kill ’em!” “Give us a score, Danny! Let’s
do ’em up, now.”</p>

<p>As if in obedience to such promptings, North
Side began again harder, more desperately than ever.
A penalty for holding put High School back to her
twenty-three yards. An end run gained but a yard,
and Brimmer punted almost straight into air. When
the ball stopped rolling it was North Side’s on High
School’s thirty-two yards. Yells of delight and encouragement
came from the stand, and Danny hurled
Wightson at the line again. Two yards resulted,
McCoy stopping the runner. Larue made four on
left tackle and was pulled down by Brimmer.
Wightson again at Fudge’s position and three yards
more were gained. Wightson at right guard and first
down made.</p>

<p>Twenty to go now. Danny Shores himself took
the ball but made no gain. Then Wightson made
three and the fullback two, and, with five to gain
on fourth down, Danny faked a place-kick and sent
Wightson straight into the line, plunging, dodging,
straining, and made the distance by a bare two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
inches, as the tape showed! Pandemonium reigned
in the North Siders’ camp. Entreaties, commands,
threats of personal violence were hurled at the players!
High School gathered herself compactly, concentrating
her whole strength behind the center of
her line. For North Side had tried no end of plays
and seemed not to have included them in her education.
But Danny Shores was red-headed, and so is a
fox. A try at the center yielded a scant two feet and
took the ball to the nine yards. Then the pigskin
was shot back to Larue and that swarthy-faced little
Canuck shot around Grover’s end like a weasel and
planted the ball just behind the left goal-post!</p>

<p>The North Side supporters were all for rushing
onto the field and carrying the heroic Larue around
on their shoulders, and it was all that Will Scott
and the officials, aided by most of the visiting team,
could do to persuade them to postpone that ceremony.
When order had been restored and the delighted
and noisily appreciative supporters had been
cajoled back of the side line again, Danny essayed to
kick the goal. But North Side’s chance to win the
game there and then was lost, for the ball went well
under the cross-bar, and High School shouted its
relief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span></p>

<p>There were still six minutes of playing time remaining,
and Captain Nostrand called on his team
to make the most of it. High School kicked off and
North Side caught and ran back to her fifteen yards.
Larue now took the brunt of the work, but his forte
was broken field running, and his attempts at the
line were less successful than Wightson’s. Nevertheless,
North Side made first down twice and took
the ball to her forty yards before she was forced to
punt. Farrar caught on High School’s thirty-three
and, behind good interference, ran back to midfield.
There a fumble lost a down, a forward pass failed,
and Brimmer punted to the opponent’s twenty.
Danny Shores made the catch, but was downed without
gain and Larue tried to win through the left of
the line without success. A fumble by Larue cost
North Side half a dozen yards, and the ball sailed
through the air to midfield again. Once more Farrar
caught and ran back, reeling off ten or twelve
yards before he was stopped. A forward pass, Farrar
to Smith, gained seven and McCoy made it first
down off left tackle. From the thirty-yard line High
School advanced to the six, mixing her plays bafflingly
and fighting with desperation. And then,
once more on the threshold of a score, luck deserted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
her. Farrar, attempting a forward pass to Grover,
found that end out of position for the catch, and so
tried, in forlorn hope, to gain around the other side.
But he was caught well back of the line and, on
third down, the ball went into play on the twelve
yards. A double pass to Brimmer for a plunge at
the left of the line failed miserably and, as a last
resort, a field-goal was attempted. But Brimmer
never had a chance to get the ball away, for the
whole right side of High School’s line crumpled
before the savage attack of the enemy, and the
fullback was downed with the pigskin in his
hands.</p>

<p>Then Fortune appeared to desert the home team
utterly. Larue got clear through, eluding the secondary
defense as though he was greased, and put
forty yards behind him before Farrar, running desperately,
brought him down from behind. From
midfield to High School’s fifteen-yard line plunged
the triumphant North Siders. High School was
weakening every minute now. Nostrand put in two
fresh linemen and replaced Burns with Sawin, but
the advance went on, Larue finding all sorts of holes
to squirm through, and the redoubtable Wightson,
rested and chafing under inactivity, returned to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
attack with redoubled fury, hurling himself at the
faltering High School line for good gains.</p>

<p>With two minutes left and the ball just inside the
third white line, High School fought for time, hopeless
now of victory and only seeking to stave off
defeat. Twice the whistle shrilled while some real
or imaginary injury was looked to, and each time
North Side raged like so many tigers who had
tasted blood.</p>

<p>“One minute and fifty-six seconds,” proclaimed
the Timer.</p>

<p>“All right now, fellows!” piped Danny. “Over
with it! Here’s where we score again!”</p>

<p>“Hold them, Scrub!” shouted Nostrand hoarsely,
and, “Throw ’em back!” yelled Farrar. “Get down
there, Shaw! Play low, fellows! Get under ’em and
throw ’em back!”</p>

<p>Then—well, no one ever had a very clear idea of
what immediately ensued. All that is known is
that somewhere between the North Side center and
Wightson the ball went astray and that for the
longest four seconds on record it bobbed and trickled
about under the feet of fully half the contending
players. But after that what happened was just this.
Fudge Shaw, who, perhaps, owed his presence at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
center more to his ability to keep his eyes on the
ball than to any other feature of his playing, was
one of the first to cry “Ball! Ball!” Also, he was
one of the first to break through. Unfortunately,
he came through on his hands and knees and his first
effort to capture the erratic pigskin only sent it
further afield. But Fudge, by a miracle of spontaneity
that must have shocked his system dreadfully,
rolled to his feet, seized the bobbing ball from
under the outstretched hands of a North Side player
and staggered off with it!</p>

<p>Having done that much, Fudge was willing to
call a halt, and he proved it by stopping stock-still
and, looking back, inviting someone to lay him low.
But, as it happened, he was for the moment unchallenged,
and instead of a tackle he received the
exultant, imperious, entreating cries of his team-mates
to “Run, Shaw!” “Go it, Fudge!” He
heard those cries plainly, in spite of the counter-cries
from the momentarily befuddled enemy, and,
although they chimed in not at all with his inclinations,
he obeyed them and started, somewhat irresolutely,
toward the far-distant goal.</p>

<p>Fudge was not built for speed. There was no
unnecessary fat on his somewhat rotund body, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
his legs were short and stocky and his strides,
lengthen them as he might, covered scant territory.
But, despairingly he ran, with the enemy momentarily
drawing nearer and nearer, a grim, flaming-haired
Danny, with “Danger” written all over him,
in the lead. To say that Fudge despaired because
the enemy promised to stop his flight would be wide
of the truth. Fudge despaired because they didn’t
hurry up and do it! Fudge had not the slightest
desire in all the wide, wide world to race at breakneck
speed down that interminable field and become
a hero. The price was too large! If someone
would only take the ball from him, it would be
fine! And, as if in answer to Fudge’s wish, Danny
Shores gained until he was close behind. And
Fudge, half closing his eyes, awaited the shock of
that tackle.</p>

<p>But it didn’t come! Feet spurned the turf behind
him, a purple-stockinged figure raced up, Danny
Shores went reeling to earth and Fudge was again
out of danger, free to carry that ball in triumph over
some eighty yards!</p>

<p>The player who had cleared Danny from his
course was the fleet-footed Grover and with a world
of entreaty in his eyes and voice, Fudge half turned,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
held the pigskin out and faltered laboredly, “Take
it!”</p>

<p>But Grover had shot his bolt. He fell behind.
Only his voice followed Fudge: “Run, Shaw!
You’ve got it!”</p>

<p>So poor Fudge, his short legs twinkling so fast
that they became a mere purplish-yellow blur, ran!
And behind him came friend and foe. Midfield
now, and still uncaptured! Only fifty yards more!
Only! The stand was shouting wildly. From the
side lines, where raced shrieking partisans of the
visitors, came cries of rage, of encouragement, of
despair! One by one the High School interference,
hastily formed but effective, performed their duty
and fell behind, and now only one of the enemy pursued
and only one of the High School players followed.
At the forty yards Fudge was gasping
painfully for breath. At the thirty he was ready,
more than ready to give up. If only, thought
Fudge, someone would pull him down! He resented
the fact that he was allowed to run his legs off, and
held it in for weeks against Danny Shores’ team
that they had so easily allowed themselves to be put
out of the running!</p>

<p>At the twenty-yard line Fudge saw the goal-posts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
distinctly for the first time and the hope that
perhaps, after all, he might reach them without
dying first came to him and encouraged him. He
never once looked back. He only hoped each moment
that hands would seize him and pull him to
earth. But Fudge’s hope was idle, for, near the
fifteen-yard line, Farrar made a final despairing
effort, flung himself in the path of the pursuing
North Sider and together they subsided, too weak
to move for many moments. And then, with the
shouts of the spectators beating on his ears like the
sound of distant surf, Fudge, unwilling hero of the
contest, fell across the last white line and sank into
peaceful coma!</p>

<small>CORWIN WINS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">While Fudge, completely exhausted, was
being restored to usefulness, Captain
Nostrand converted the six points to
seven by an easy goal. And before Fudge, assisted
by admiring team-mates, had reached the bench the
game was over, High School had won, 13 to 6, the
North Siders were dejectedly leaving the field and
Fudge had leaped into fame! A full eighty-five
yards, they called that run, which, allowing for slight
exaggeration born of enthusiasm, it was. But Fudge,
with becoming modesty, insisted that it hadn’t been a
foot over eighty-three! Back in the dressing-room,
having recovered breath and presence of mind,
Fudge rendered his version of the feat to a respectfully
attentive audience.</p>

<p>“I saw the fumble and tried to get through, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
their center blocked me off and I had to crawl under
him. I could almost reach the ball, but not
quite; I touched it, I think. Then I dived across for
it, knocking a couple of North Siders out of my
way, and picked it up right under the nose of that
fellow Wightson. My, but he was mad! Then I
started down the field, and——”</p>

<p>“What did you stop for?” asked some one puzzledly.</p>

<p>Fudge’s modesty again asserted itself. “Well,”
he answered frankly, “I’m no sprinter; not built for
it. I can run a long time, but I’m not fast, if you
see what I mean. So I thought that if I could pass
the ball to one of you fellows who was a better
sprinter I’d do it. You see, it didn’t matter who
made the runs so long as we got the touchdown.”
Faint murmurs of admiration greeted this noble
sentiment. Pete Farrar’s countenance expressed
slight amazement. It didn’t sound quite like Fudge.
Still, that youth’s expression was so guileless that
Pete concluded that perhaps, after all, Fudge was as
unselfish as he pictured himself. “There was no one
to take it, though,” continued the hero, warming
to the narrative; “and so I saw that I’d have to
make the score myself. Shores was right after me,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
and a lot of the others too. Once Shores almost
had me, but I swung aside——”</p>

<p>“It was Grover who put Shores out,” said
Sawin.</p>

<p>“I know. It was good work, too,” declared
Fudge heartily. “But he wouldn’t have caught me,
because I’d got my second-wind by that time, and
the rest was easy. With the start I had none of
them could have caught me.”</p>

<p>“Hm,” said Captain Nostrand, “you sort of hate
yourself, don’t you, Fudge?”</p>

<p>But the consensus of opinion was that Nostrand’s
sarcasm was in poor taste, although perhaps excusable
to some extent since envy is a common failing.
Nor was Sprague McCoy’s remark thought
any better of. McCoy chuckled and observed: “I
thought once or twice, Fudge, you were going to
lie down and go to sleep! The trouble with you is
that you’re geared too high!”</p>

<p>Fudge smiled patiently, sweetly, as if to say:
“’Twas ever thus! Success is always a target for
the shafts of Envy!”</p>

<p>At that moment, as if Fate sought to secure an
even balance between joy and sorrow, Jim Grover,
who had gone to the telephone a minute before,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
hung up the receiver and faced the others with
gloomy countenance.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t that make you sick?” he demanded.
“Corwin won!”</p>

<p>There was an instant of silence. Then, “Who
says so?” demanded McCoy incredulously.</p>

<p>“I called up Castle’s. They got it by telephone
from Corwin. Twelve to ten. What do you know
about that?”</p>

<p>Grover kicked disgustedly at a bench.</p>

<p>A chorus of dismay arose. “Twelve to ten?
How’d we make ten?” “Touchdown, goal and
field-goal, of course.” “Isn’t that the limit? Say,
they ought to let us play instead of the Varsity!”
“We haven’t won a game since Methuselah was in
rompers!” “Wait till you hear them roast Lovering!
Wow! I wouldn’t be in his shoes for anything!”
“Did they say anything about it, Jim?”</p>

<p>“No, they just heard the score, that’s all. Gee,
I wish Lovering would quit his kindergarten stuff
and let us spring some plays! We never will win
a game with the sort of things he gives us!”</p>

<p>“Well, that comes of putting a fellow who doesn’t
know football in as coach,” declared Burns. “It’s
up to Lanny White, all right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span></p>

<p>“What’s the good of knocking every time we get
licked?” demanded Nostrand. “It doesn’t do any
good. Wait till you hear what the trouble was
before you begin criticising.”</p>

<p>“Everyone knows what the trouble is,” responded
McCoy gloomily. “Lovering doesn’t care
whether we win or lose. All he cares about is
Springdale.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s right,” replied Grover, reflectively
and more cheerfully. “After all, if we win that
game——”</p>

<p>“<em>If</em> we do!” said Thad Brimmer. “But how are
we going to if we can’t beat these smaller teams?
Bet you anything you like that the Varsity would
fall dead if it won a game!”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” Fudge spoke up, “but you’ll
all be talking out of the other side of your mouth
pretty soon. Dick knows just what he’s doing, and
don’t you forget it!” And Fudge, looking unusually
belligerent by reason of his inflamed nose, faced
them indignantly. “What if we do get beaten by
Corwin and Logan and all those little fellows?
What we’re after is to smear Springdale, and we’ll
do it, too, if we’ll leave Dick Lovering alone and
not kick him in the shins every time we get a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
chance! You make me weary, you gang of
grouches!”</p>

<p>Fudge was a hero just now and his words were
hearkened to with respect. An uncertain murmur of
approval followed, and some laughter, and Grover
said: “I guess that’s so, fellows. Let’s leave Lovering
alone. Anyway, I’m going home. Who’s coming
along?”</p>

<p>And so, although the Scrub triumphed that day,
the Varsity trailed home with a third defeat pinned
to it, and the school was at first incredulous, then
disgusted and, finally, resentful. Explanations and
excuses didn’t satisfy. A few fellows who had journeyed
to Corwin and witnessed the game declared
that hard luck and not poor work had been to blame
for the defeat; that on merit Clearfield should have
conquered by at least one score. The school at large
listened but was unconvinced. “Beaten again!” it
said. “Three games lost out of five played! What
sort of a team have we got, anyway? What’s Dick
Lovering think he’s doing? Playing ‘give-away’?”</p>

<p>There had been extenuating circumstances, however,
whether the fellows were willing to believe it
or not. Clearfield had distinctly outplayed her opponent
in three of the four periods, had gained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
more ground by rushing, had punted farther and
had shown better generalship. In short, she had
fairly deserved to win. But there is no denying
that success is what counts, and she had not succeeded.</p>

<p>She had fought her way half the length of the
field for a clean, well-earned touchdown in the second
period and had kicked the goal. She had again
rushed nearly sixty yards in the third quarter, and,
being held for three downs, had sent a field-goal
over for three more points. She had secured the
ball two minutes later near the Corwin goal and
almost scored again, a fumbled ball which every fellow
on the eleven declared had been recovered by
Tupper, being awarded to Corwin on the latter’s
four yards. And, in the final period, when, with
the score 12 to 10 against her, she had twice attempted
goals from the field, either of which would
have given her a victory, Morris Brent had failed
dismally to make good. Not once, declared Lanny
resentfully, had the luck broken for Clearfield. All
during the contest Fortune had glaringly befriended
the adversary. Even Corwin’s first touchdown
could not be justly said to have been deserved, for
the ball had been Clearfield’s on her twelve yards,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
succeeding a punt by the opponent, and, after off-side
penalties had twice been imposed on Clearfield
when Corwin had equally offended, a blocked-kick
had been downed by Corwin behind High School’s
line. But all this failed to impress the supporters
of the team and by Monday feeling against Dick,
or, perhaps, against what the school termed his system,
was running high. One heard criticism everywhere,
sometimes mildly sarcastic, more often angry
and bitter. Some wag evolved a conundrum
that circulated through school: “What’s the matter
with the football team?” “Too many Beatons!”
Unfortunately for the perfect success of the conundrum,
the question elicited so many explanations
and theories that the answer, when it arrived, fell
rather flat.</p>

<p>Just who started the agitation for a mass-meeting
to protest against the conduct of football affairs
never transpired. But the project met with instant
acclaim and a notice suddenly appeared on the bulletin-board
in the school corridor Monday noon.
The meeting was to be held at eight o’clock Tuesday
evening, announced the notice, in the assembly
hall, and all students were requested to attend. The
signature, “Committee of Twelve,” produced much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
speculation, but no one could or would throw light
on the identity of the twelve. Dick, attracted to
the bulletin-board by the group in front of it, read
the announcement on his way out of the building
in the afternoon. The group faded away as he
pushed forward, although several of its component
parts halted at a distance to observe the effect on
the coach. They had their labor for their pains, for
Dick showed neither by attitude nor expression that
the notice conveyed anything to him. He passed out
with his usual half-smiling gravity, nodding to those
he passed, and it was not until he was climbing into
his blue runabout that the half-smile faded from
his face and his expression became thoroughly serious.</p>

<p>At the field Lanny broached the subject laughingly.
“Heard about the indignation meeting,
Dick?” he asked at the dressing-room door. Dick
nodded. “A lot of sore-heads,” Lanny grumbled.
“I’ve a good mind to take a bunch of the fellows
and bust up the meeting!”</p>

<p>“Better let them alone,” counseled Dick. “I don’t
much blame them for getting peeved. Still, if you’re
going—and there’s no reason why you shouldn’t—I’ll
run around and get you about half-past seven.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span></p>

<p>“You mean that—that you’re going?” asked
Lanny in surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes, didn’t you notice that the ‘Committee’
wanted everyone to come?” asked Dick, with a
twinkle in his eye. “Yes, I shall go, and, if they’ll
let me, I’ll have a few words to say.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t trouble to talk to them,” expostulated
Lanny. “Just let them spout and get it off
their chests, Dick. It’ll do them good.”</p>

<p>“All they want,” said Chester Cottrell, who had
joined them, “is a chance to make some speeches
and roast some one. Then they’ll forget all about
it, Dick.”</p>

<p>“Maybe, but they’re dissatisfied with the way I’m
running things, Chester, and I don’t want their antagonism
toward me to spread to the team. There’s
nothing worse than for a school to go back on the
team. Every player feels it and it takes the heart
out of him. I don’t say that they will do that, but
they might, and if I can put things before them so
they’ll see, at least, that it isn’t the team’s fault that
we’re getting licked so often, I think I’d better.
They’re at liberty to roast me as much as they
please. I guess any football coach expects a certain
amount of that sort of thing, and he can’t afford to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
be sensitive. Besides, I hope to show them in the
end that I’m not as bad as they think!”</p>

<p>“All right, Dick,” agreed Lanny, doubtfully, “go
ahead and give ’em fits! We’ll go and back you up.”</p>

<p>“But don’t go there in a bunch and sit together
and try to—well, intimidate them,” smiled Dick.
“Free speech for all, Lanny! Let them say what
they want to. After they’ve said it I’ll try to satisfy
them that there’s nothing wrong with the team,
no matter how punk the coach may be!”</p>

<p>“And I’ll tell them, by George, that the coach is
all right and knows what he’s doing a heap better
than they do, the silly galoots!” exclaimed Lanny
indignantly.</p>

<p>“You sit tight and say nothing,” replied Dick.
“Let me do the explaining. All right now. Get
your men out. We’re ten minutes late.”</p>

<small>LANNY VISITS THE OFFICE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Practice was light that Monday afternoon,
for many of the boys had suffered slight
bruises or muscle-strains in the Corwin game
and all were more or less languid as a result of the
continued warm weather, while, to make easy work
more advisable, the light drizzle which had been
falling since early morning had made the field slippery.
Several of the Varsity players were excused
altogether, among them Tom Haley, who had stood
a good deal of punishment, and Lanny White, who
showed unmistakable signs of a disposition to go
“fine.” Everyone moved slowly, sluggishly to-day,
and the jump that Chester Cottrell usually managed
to put into the team was noticeably lacking. Morris
Brent tried a few field-goals and did so well that it
was difficult to believe that he had twice failed on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
Saturday. After practice was over, and it ended
long before dusk to-day, Morris waited for Dick
and Gordon, who emerged together from the dressing-room
under the stand, and walked with them
across to where the blue runabout, its top glistening
with rain, stood in the lee of the fence.</p>

<p>“That stuff’s come,” he announced. “The fellow
at the freight office called me up after school. I
was afraid it wasn’t going to get here in time.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to move it to-night?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“That’s what I wanted to ask you about. Mr.
Grayson’s birthday is Wednesday and we’ve got to
get the things in his office to-morrow evening. So
it doesn’t seem to me much use to move it twice.
What do you think? Why not have Stuart load
it on a team to-morrow afternoon before the freight
shed closes and pull it to his stable and then bring
it around to the school later, say about nine? The
dickens of it is that we’ll have to wait until that old
meeting is over, I suppose. We don’t want the
whole school messing around while we’re moving
it in and getting the wrappings off. I wish they’d
selected some other evening for their silly meeting.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but you can wait until the fellows go home.
I don’t see any reason for moving it twice, either,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
Morris. Your scheme looks all right. Don’t you
think so, Gordie?”</p>

<p>“Yes. You’ll want help to get the stuff unpacked,
I suppose.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe so. Louise and Nell are coming
around, and Owen, the janitor, will be there to
help. I can manage all right. Unless,” he added,
“you want to have a hand in it.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be much use, I guess,” replied Dick.
“I won’t come unless I’m needed. By the way,
I’ve got some money for you at home. I’ve
collected all but about three dollars.”</p>

<p>“Me, too,” said Gordon. “Only I’ve got more
than three to get yet. Some of the younger fellows
hate like anything to give up their money. Get
in, Dick, and I’ll turn her over.”</p>

<p>“Coming along, Morris?” asked Dick, climbing
in and laying his crutches in the improvised rack
on the running-board. “You can sit on the floor
if you don’t mind.”</p>

<p>“Get in the seat,” said Gordon. “I’ll squat. All
set?”</p>

<p>“All set,” answered Dick. Gordon twirled the
starting crank and Eli began to whir merrily.
Gordon closed the gate behind the car and seated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
himself on the floor, and Eli chugged off down A
Street toward Brentwood.</p>

<p>“By the way,” announced Morris, “the girls are
going around to the meeting to-morrow night,
Dick. Louise is sputtering with indignation and
declares that if it comes to a vote they’ll see that
you come out all right!”</p>

<p>“Votes for women!” laughed Dick. “That’s very
nice of them, but I’m afraid the fellows won’t
appreciate their presence.”</p>

<p>“So I told her,” said Morris, “but she says that
all the students are asked to attend and that the
girls are just as much students as the boys are.
Anyway, she’s going, and she’s made about thirty
others promise to go, too. I guess it’s going to be
quite an affair!”</p>

<p>“It looks so,” replied Dick dryly. “Whoa, Eli!
Good night, Morris. Let me know if I can do anything
to help with the furniture, please.”</p>

<p>As they started off again Gordon began to chuckle
and Dick viewed him inquiringly. “Tell me about
it,” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s nothing, Dick. I was just thinking.”</p>

<p>“Does it always affect you like that?”</p>

<p>“Not always. Only when it’s funny. You see,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
I was thinking about Louise going to the meeting.
It’s fine to have the ladies on your side, Dick.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” grunted Dick.</p>

<p>“I suppose it’s because you’re such a handsome
beast. Still, you’ve got a way with you, too. If
it was anyone else, now, Louise——”</p>

<p>“Do you want to land in the gutter?” asked Dick
carelessly.</p>

<p>“N-no, not especially, thanks.”</p>

<p>“Then cut out the comedy.”</p>

<p>“All right. But I can keep on thinking, can’t I?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if you don’t do it so I can hear you. Here’s
where you get out, anyway. Beat it!”</p>

<p>“Thank you. And good night, you old heart-breaker!”</p>

<p>The next morning when Lanny reached school he
found a summons from the Principal awaiting him
and sought the office with trepidation. He wasn’t
aware of having transgressed any rules and his
class standing was no worse than it had been all the
Fall. In fact, for the last fortnight he thought he
had been doing considerably better. The office was
on the main floor of the building, at the end of the
long corridor. Mr. Grayson greeted the visitor
pleasantly and asked him to be seated. “Just a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
moment, White, if you please,” he added as he
returned to some writing he was doing.</p>

<p>Mr. Grayson was short and square, with a head
that seemed just a little too large for his body.
His thick, wiry hair was sprinkled with gray, as
was his short beard and closely-cropped mustache.
From behind his glasses a pair of mild, thoughtful
brown eyes looked gravely on the world from under
heavy, grizzled brows. Mr. Grayson impressed one
as being strong physically and mentally, and not
only strong but capable. His countenance, in spite
of its accustomed gravity—and the Principal was
seldom seen to smile—was, on the whole, pleasant
and kindly.</p>

<p>While Mr. Grayson continued his writing, Lanny
looked about the office with a new interest. It
did, he told himself, certainly need new furnishings.
The carpet, always too small for the big room, was
threadbare in places and so faded that it was difficult
to guess its original color. The flat-top oak desk was
stained and battered, and when, presently, the Principal
leaned back in his swivel-chair it squeaked
most excruciatingly. Mr. Grayson removed his
glasses and, being nearsighted, squinted a little as
he turned to Lanny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span></p>

<p>“Well, White, how are football affairs getting
on?” he asked.</p>

<p>Lanny was so greatly relieved to find that he
was not in for a caution regarding his class standing
that for an instant he found it hard to focus his
thoughts on the question. Finally, however, “Why,
pretty well, sir,” he answered vaguely.</p>

<p>“Hm!” Mr. Grayson thoughtfully polished the
lenses of his glasses with a silk handkerchief which
he carried for the purpose. “Mr. Carter talked
to me over the ’phone last evening. He seemed to
think that there was some dissatisfaction on the part
of the school. He said his son had told him the
boys were quite excited and were talking of appealing
to the Athletic Committee to do something, I
don’t know just what.”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter was one of the graduate members
of the Committee and had a son in High School.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, there is some talk,” acknowledged
Lanny. “There’s to be a meeting to-night. The
fellows don’t like it that the team has been beaten
so often. But I don’t see what good it is going to
do to stir up a lot of talk and trouble, Mr. Grayson.”</p>

<p>“I see. Mr. Carter rather inferred that the boys
held the coach to blame. Is that the way it is?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, I think so. They seem to have it in for
the team and for Lovering too. We haven’t made
a very good showing so far, sir, and that’s a fact,
but Lovering’s aiming at the Springdale game and
doesn’t care so much about the others. As far as
I’m concerned, I’d like to win them all, but Dick
seems to think we can’t do that, and I’m willing
to stand back of Dick, Mr. Grayson.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he—well, knows his business,
White?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I do,” replied Lanny decidedly. “He
may be a little—a little too cautious, but I think if
the fellows will let him alone he will bring the team
around in good shape for the big game.”</p>

<p>“I see. And the other members of the team,
White? They think as you do about Lovering?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, as far as I know. We’d all like to have
won more games than we have, but it isn’t fair to
put the blame on Dick, Mr. Grayson; anyway, not
all of it. The team isn’t as far advanced as it
was a year ago at this time, but not having any
coach at the beginning of the season made a
difference.”</p>

<p>“Hm. Last year Springdale won, I believe.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. That’s just it. We won all our early<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
games but one and then got beaten badly by
Springdale.”</p>

<p>“I see. Well, that’s all I wanted to know, White.
I thought that it might be well to understand the
sentiment of the team itself in case—well, in case
the matter came before the Committee. I hope
Lovering’s method will succeed. That’s all, then,
thanks, White. Not very good weather for football,
I take it.”</p>

<p>“No, sir, not very. Good morning, sir.”</p>

<p>Lanny retired from the interview well satisfied.
If, as was not improbable, the meeting voted to
appeal to the Athletic Committee, Mr. Grayson
would, Lanny felt, use his influence against any
interference with the coach’s conduct of affairs.
That there would be any demand for a change of
coach was not at all likely, for even the most dissatisfied
would surely recognize the folly of, so to
say, swapping horses in mid-stream. But the meeting
might ask and the Committee might have consented
to some policy of interference that would
have worried Dick and seriously handicapped him.
But with Mr. Grayson on their side, Lanny reflected,
it was very unlikely that anything of the sort would
occur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span></p>

<p>“They may talk their silly heads off now,” he said
to himself, “and much good it will do ’em!”</p>

<p>It stopped raining at noon and the field, though
by no means in perfect condition, was better than
the day before and practice went very well. Bruises
and strains were forgotten, and a little cold breeze
that made itself felt in the afternoon and sent the
heavy clouds scurrying southward put more spirit
into the fellows. The Varsity had little difficulty
in scoring once in each of the three periods of the
game against the Scrubs, and the fellows showed
possibilities of attack that were distinctly encouraging.
The handful of spectators who braved the
weather and watched practice were, in many cases
unwillingly, impressed with the work of the Varsity.</p>

<p>The mass-meeting had been called for eight
o’clock, and long before that hour the assembly
hall on the upper floor of the school building was
well-filled. The advent of some thirty-odd girls
occasioned amusement and surprise, even, I regret
to say, some ridicule. But Louise Brent and her
following paid no heed to the expressions of the
latter. The girls found seats together at one side
of the hall and calmly awaited events. Most of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
football players were there, although, following
Dick’s instructions, they were careful not to group
themselves. Dick arrived just before the meeting
was called to order and his appearance created something
of a sensation. He found an empty seat
half-way from the front on a side aisle and lowered
himself into it quite unembarrassedly. Some one
started to clap, but the demonstration was quickly
hushed. After that the hall was very quiet for
several minutes. The clock over the platform announced
eight-three. At last Sears, the President
of the Senior Class, arose from his place near the
front and faced the meeting.</p>

<p>“I have been asked,” announced Sears, “in the
absence of—of anyone as obliging, to explain the
purpose of this meeting. First off, though, I want
to say that I take no sides in this business. I’m neutral.”
Some laughter and applause greeted this.
“As I understand it,” he went on, “we are here to
talk over the football situation and, possibly, take
steps to improve it. Just now the first thing to do
is, I presume, to appoint a chairman. Nominations
are in order.”</p>

<p>“I nominate Toby Sears,” said some one.</p>

<p>“Second it!” called another voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span></p>

<p>“You’ve heard the motion, fellows. Those in
favor will say ‘Aye,’ opposed, ‘No.’ The ayes have
it. It is a vote.” Sears left his place on the floor
and ascended the platform, taking his seat behind
the small table in the center. “Now, gentlemen,
what is your pleasure?”</p>

<small>THE INDIGNATION MEETING</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">For a minute no one accepted the invitation,
and chuckles of amusement came from the
rear of the hall where the younger fellows
were foregathered. Finally, “Go to it, Carter!”
called one of the irrepressibles, and Ned Carter, a
serious-visaged Junior arose slowly to his feet.</p>

<p>“Carter,” said Sears in recognition.</p>

<p>“Mr. Chairman and fellows,” began Carter, “a
lot of us fellows aren’t at all satisfied with the way
things are going. I mean about football. Our team
has played five games so far and it’s been licked three
times. We want to know what the reason is.”
Applause was instantaneous, and the speaker, encouraged,
thrust his hands in his trousers pockets
and went on with more assurance. “We started
out all right, as you all know. We didn’t have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
any trouble beating Highland Hall. Then we got
a coach and—and things haven’t gone so well. I
haven’t got anything against the coach personally.
None of us have. We know him and we think
he’s a fine fellow. But it stands to reason that a
fellow who has never played football and never
coached a team before isn’t the best sort of a fellow
to coach for us. I’m not saying it’s his fault that
we’ve made such a poor showing so far, but I do
think it’s somebody’s fault. A lot of us fellows——”</p>

<p>“You s-s-said that b-b-before,” called Fudge in
a voice audible to most of the gathering, and a ripple
of amusement started and was met by hisses and
cries of “Shut up!” and “Put him out!” Carter
proceeded doggedly.</p>

<p>“A lot of us fellows want to know whose fault
it is. That’s why this meeting was called. And
what I say is, let’s talk it over and find out what’s
best to be done and—and do it.”</p>

<p>Carter subsided amidst applause, some of it
ironic, and the tall and lanky Bingham sought
recognition. Bingham had a smirk on his face,
and those who knew him best expected something
particularly disagreeable from him. Nor were they
disappointed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span></p>

<p>“Carter,” began Bingham, “says somebody is to
blame for the way things have been going and that
we ought to find out who it is. Seems to me it
isn’t very hard to find out. We’ve got as good a
lot of players as we’ve ever had, I guess. You
all saw what they did to Highland Hall, the first
of the season, before there was any interference.
The team was all right then. Then they went and
got a coach, and what happened?” Bingham paused
impressively.</p>

<p>“Tell us, little one, what did happen,” pleaded
a falsetto voice from the far side of the hall. Bingham
frowned at the unseemly mirth which ensued
at this witticism and hastened to forestall further
interruptions.</p>

<p>“Since we have had our <em>coach</em>—” and his emphasis
on the word was unpleasantly sarcastic—“we’ve
played five games against weak teams and been
beaten in three of them! I guess we ought to be
thankful we haven’t got <em>two</em> coaches. If we had
we might have been beaten in all of them!” The
effort at humor aroused a few uncertain chuckles.
“I say it isn’t hard to place the blame for the punk
condition of our team, and it isn’t, either. The
fellows are all right. They do as they are told.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
The trouble is the fellow who tells them what to
do doesn’t know his business. He’s had no experience.
He never played a game of football in
his life. He couldn’t because——”</p>

<p>“Shame!” cried the girls, and some of the audience
hissed. Sears rapped his knuckles smartly on
the table.</p>

<p>“The meeting will come to order,” he said severely.
“And I must warn the speaker that personalities
must be kept out of this discussion.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Chairman, I am speaking of the football
coach. If we can’t discuss the coach what’s the good
of this meeting? Besides, I see that he is here in
person to answer for himself. I suppose he thought
that if he came we wouldn’t dare criticize him. If
he thought that he is dead wrong. We have a
right to protest against his haphazard, ridiculous
system of coaching and to demand that he either
show results or yield his position to some one else,
some one who at least knows the difference between
a touchdown and a head-guard!”</p>

<p>“Nominate Bingham for coach!” shouted a small
youth in the back of the hall and this time the
laughter was spontaneous and prolonged, so prolonged,
in spite of the chairman’s stern demands for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
order, that Bingham, who evidently intended to say
more, hesitated and finally sat down.</p>

<p>Several other speakers followed. One, a Senior
named Lewis, spoke well and rationally. “I regret
that previous speakers have seen fit to lay the blame
for the state of affairs on Dick Lovering, our coach.
He doesn’t deserve it. Things don’t seem to be
going very well, and that’s a fact, but I don’t think
there’s anyone to blame for it. The trouble began
when we lost Farrell. The team went on for some
two weeks, I believe, without anyone in charge, and
Captain White had everything to attend to, assisted,
of course, by the manager. We all know that White
tried his best to find a man to take Farrell’s place,
and that he couldn’t do it. Then the Athletic
Committee decided not to pay a salary this year,
and that settled all chance of getting anyone with
experience. As a last resort Captain White and
some of the players went to Dick Lovering and
asked him to coach the team. Lovering didn’t ask
for the place and didn’t want it. He refused at
first, I am told, and finally consented because White
and the others wouldn’t take No. Lovering has
made no claims to be an experienced football coach.
The fellows didn’t think he was. But they had to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
have some one and Lovering was the only fellow in
sight. If things haven’t gone as well as they might
have you can’t lay any blame to Lovering. He may
be partly accountable, but he isn’t to blame. He’s
done the best he’s known how. I’m certain of
that. Perhaps he has made mistakes. I confess I
don’t know, for I’m no football authority. But I
<em>am</em> sure he has done his level best and worked hard.
Now the whole thing amounts to this. You’re not
satisfied with the progress the team has made.
Probably the team itself isn’t. Perhaps if methods
of instruction or coaching or whatever you have a
mind to call it, were altered things would go better.
Lovering himself is here this evening. Before we
go any further, why not hear from him? Perhaps
he can satisfy us that things aren’t as bad as they
seem, that they’re going to be a lot better and that
when we run against Springdale next month we’re
going to lick her. If we do that we’ll have done
what we want most to do, and we’ll forget all about
what went before. I’d like to hear from Coach
Lovering.”</p>

<p>There followed much applause as Dick put his
crutches under his arms, arose and faced the meeting.
Then the hand-clapping subsided and an expectant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
silence ensued. Dick looked sober but quite
untroubled. He began to speak in a quiet voice
plainly heard all over the hall and in crisp, businesslike
tones.</p>

<p>“Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen,” began
Dick, “I thank the last speaker for his expressions
of good will. And I am very glad of this opportunity
to say a few words. But if you expect me to
make a defense of my methods you will be disappointed.
Lewis outlined better than I could the
events of this present football season. I was chosen,
as he has told you, not because I had ever coached
a team, not because I claimed that I could coach a
team, but because there seemed no one else to fill
the position. And I did hold off for awhile, not
because I didn’t want to do it, for I did, and not
because I thought I couldn’t do it, for I had a
strong impression that I could. Lewis says that I
must not be held to blame. I say that if there is
any blame it’s mine. I’m ready to accept it
and——”</p>

<p>Dick’s friends and not a few of the opposition
applauded warmly.</p>

<p>“And I want to accept it. But especially I want
you to believe that the team is not at fault. We’ve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
got a good team, a fine lot of players, willing,
hard-working, cheerful. It’s not the best team we’ve
ever had. None of you will claim that. But it’s
more than an average good one. It’s good enough
to beat Springdale. I say that assuredly. If it
doesn’t beat Springdale the fault will be mine and
not the players’. But I don’t think it’s going to be
necessary to find fault with anyone, for I firmly
believe we’re going to win.”</p>

<p>More applause then, heartier and less restricted
to the element supporting the speaker. But with it
came a challenge from across the hall: “Talk’s
cheap, Lovering! Show us something!” “That’s
right!” cried Carter. “Win a game and we’ll believe
it!”</p>

<p>“My one reason for speaking this evening,” continued
Dick, calmly, “is to tell you plainly, to
thoroughly convince you that if we have lost three
games out of five it is not the fault of the players.
I don’t say that we could have won all five games,
but I am pretty sure that we could have won three
of them. That we didn’t was because I thought
it unwise to push the team, as it would have had to
be pushed, to a condition where it could have won.
This, please understand, is not an apology, but merely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
an explanation. Not only did I think that the
team should not have been pushed then, but I still
think it should not be pushed, and I shall not be
in the least surprised if we are again defeated next
Saturday.”</p>

<p>A howl of protest greeted that announcement.
Sears rapped hard for order. Dick smiled slightly
and waited. When comparative silence fell once
more he went on.</p>

<p>“When I accepted the honor of the position I
hold—and it is an honor, and I appreciate it—it
was with the distinct understanding that I was to
have a free hand. So far I have had it. And I
intend to have it, with all respect to you, as long as
I am in charge. I am doing my best to turn out
a team that will win from Springdale High School,
and I tell you frankly that I don’t care a button
how many lickings we get meanwhile. Springdale
has a strong team this year; it looks now as if she
would be stronger than last year, when she had no
trouble beating us. Some fellows might win all or
nearly all of the early games and then win from
Springdale with the material we have this Fall.
But I tell you candidly that I am afraid to risk it.
I am working for just one result and to obtain that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
result I am going about it in the manner I think
best. And I firmly believe that my work should be
judged by whether or not I obtain the result I am
after. I have no wish to antagonize a single fellow,
a single person, in this hall to-night, but I tell you
quite frankly that I shall continue to go my own
way as long as I am coach, that I shall not resign
and that I shall resist to the utmost any attempt
to oust me. I thank you for listening so patiently.”</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence. Then applause
broke out deafeningly. Hand-clapping, shouts,
stamping made a pandemonium of the meeting.
Sears helplessly banged on the table. Half a dozen
fellows claimed recognition. But it was long before
Sears could make himself heard. When he at last
succeeded it was in recognition of Sprague McCoy.</p>

<p>“Mr. Chairman!” shouted McCoy, trying to be
heard the length of the assembly hall above the din.
“Mr. Chairman, I move you that a vote of confidence
be given Coach Lovering, doggone it!”</p>

<p>Laughter, shouts of approval, cries of disapprobation
followed. Carter, Bingham and half a dozen
others sought for recognition. But Sears was
strangely blind. Several fellows seconded the motion
and Sears rapped and rapped for order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span></p>

<p>“Are you ready for the question?”</p>

<p>“All right!” “Yes, let her go!” “Shoot, Officer!”</p>

<p>“All in favor will say Aye!... Contrary....
It is a vote!... Is there ... further business
... meeting?” Sears’ voice was only heard at
intervals. “If not ... adjourn ... in order.”</p>

<p>“Move we adjourn!” shouted Guy Felker.</p>

<p>“Second it!”</p>

<p>“Moved and seconded that the meeting now adjourn,”
mumbled Sears. “All those....”</p>

<p>What followed was lost in the scraping of settees
and the jumble of talk and laughter. The indignation
meeting was at an end!</p>

<small>MR. GRAYSON IS SURPRISED</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Dick’s retirement from the hall took on
the nature of an ovation. Many of the
fellows pushed their way across to shake
hands with him, to tell him “It was hot stuff,
Dick!” to form a laughing, excited escort for him
to the door. Louise Brent met him on the way out.
“It was splendid!” she declared warmly. “I’m so
glad, Dick!” Toby Sears, too, reached him before
he had left the hall, and slapped him on the shoulder.
“That was good plain talk, Dick, and we needed it,”
he said.</p>

<p>Dick went off in the runabout with George Cotner,
while Gordon and Morris, waiting on the steps
for the crowd to leave, reviewed events with much
chuckling. “He did just the right thing,” said
Gordon. “If he had been apologetic and tried to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
explain things and made promises they’d have
roasted him and probably voted to take the matter
to the Committee.”</p>

<p>“Surest thing you know,” agreed Morris. “He
took just the right line with ’em.”</p>

<p>“You bet he did! He just—just edified them!
And now he’s got them eating out of his hand! It
was a regular stampede!”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet Carter and Bingham and some of those
others are as mad as hornets,” chuckled Morris.
“It won’t do them any good, though.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit. Dick’s got a big majority with him
now. Bet you we could lose every other game
except Springdale and not hear a yip out of any of
them! Dick’s a wonder, Morris. He always seems
to know what to do, doesn’t he?”</p>

<p>“He certainly does. He’s what you call a born
leader, Dick is. I wish this bunch would hurry up
and go. It’s almost a quarter past nine, and I told
Stuart to get here at half-past. I hope he doesn’t
show up before the crowd gets away.”</p>

<p>“Oh, they’ll be gone in a minute. Where is
Louise?”</p>

<p>“She and Nell have gone over to Miss Turner’s
to get the key to the office. They’ll be back at half-past.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
I sort of wish they’d put that electric light
out on the corner. If Mr. Grayson happened to
go by and saw us unloading stuff——”</p>

<p>“He’s not likely to, I guess. He lives at the other
end of town. Hello, Jim. Oh, we’re just communing
with Nature. It sure was some meeting. Good
night!”</p>

<p>The last of the audience left the building and
presently quiet fell, broken finally by the sound of
the janitor’s steps on the stairs.</p>

<p>“That you, Owen?” called Morris. “The load’s
coming in about fifteen minutes. We’d better unpack
the things inside, hadn’t we? Can you leave
a light here at the doorway?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the reply. “I’ll leave this one goin’
and the one around the corner.” The janitor, a
sturdy young Irishman, came to the door and
peered out. “Who’s that with you, Mr. Brent?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Gordon Merrick. My sister and Miss Sawin
are coming in a few minutes. I guess it will take
all of us to move the desk in, eh?”</p>

<p>“A couple of us can manage it, sir. I’ve got my
broom and dustpan here to clear up afterwards.
There’s some one coming now, ain’t there?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span></p>

<p>“Those are the girls,” said Gordon. “What time
is it?”</p>

<p>“Nearly half-past,” answered Morris, holding the
face of his watch to the dim light from the hall.
“He may be a few minutes late, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“I think I hear a wagon now,” said Gordon, as
the girls joined them. But it proved to be a milkman’s
cart when it came into sight.</p>

<p>“Did you get it?” asked Morris.</p>

<p>“Yes.” In proof, Louise held up the key. “I
feel just like a conspirator,” she added, “don’t you?
Have they all gone?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and it’s a good thing we didn’t tell that
we were going to put the things in here to-night.
If we had we’d have had half the school messing
around.”</p>

<p>“Most of them have forgotten about it, I guess,”
said Gordon. “Here he comes!”</p>

<p>Five minutes later the wagon with its mysteriously
hidden load was backed to the steps and the driver
and Owen, assisted by the two boys, were carrying
the load inside. They worked quickly and silently,
and in a very few minutes the wagon was empty
and they were removing the wrappings from the
articles. At this task all took a hand and the hallway<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
was soon littered with burlaps and excelsior
and paper. Then, tiptoeing like the conspirators
they felt themselves to be, they descended on the
office. One of the lights was lighted and turned
low, the shades were drawn and they began to move
the old furniture out into the hall, from where,
later, when the Principal had rescued his papers and
books it was to be taken to the basement. When the
carpet was up Owen applied the broom diligently.
Then the refurnishing began. The new carpet, a
deep-toned brown with a brown and blue border,
made to fit the floor exactly from measurements
taken by Miss Turner, was put in place and the big
desk was set in the middle. As each piece was
brought in Louise and Nell attacked it energetically
with dust-clothes. The swivel-chair was put in
front of the desk, the leather easy-chair—well, if
it wasn’t exactly real leather it looked just like it
and the distinguished salesman had given his solemn
word of honor that it would wear even better than
leather—was set by the windows, the filing-cabinet
was set against the wall, the straight-backed chair
went by the door and the new wastebasket, for
fear it would not be seen, was put beside the desk
rather than under it. Then books, writing pad, ink-well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
and such things were put in place and, finally,
for just a minute, the light was turned on full that
they might all see the transformation at its best.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t everything look lovely!” breathed Nell
rapturously.</p>

<p>“You’d never know it was the same room!” said
Louise. “Isn’t the desk beautiful, Gordon?”</p>

<p>“Peachy! Everything is. I’m crazy about the
rug. It will be a real privilege now to get ‘called
in’ by Mr. Grayson!”</p>

<p>“They’re fine things, they are,” declared Owen,
admiringly, as he wiped off a speck of dust with the
sleeve of his coat, “and it’s proud he’ll be in the
mornin’!”</p>

<p>“An’ there ain’t a scratch on anyone of ’em,”
said the driver of the wagon. “I seen to that, boys.”</p>

<p>“Er—yes,” murmured Morris, directing an inquiring
look at Louise. Louise nodded vehemently
and a half-dollar changed hands. “Thank you
kindly, sir,” said the driver. “Is that all I can do
for you?”</p>

<p>“That’s all, thanks,” replied Louise. “Please tell
Mr. Stuart we are very much obliged to him for
doing everything so nicely.” The man took his
departure and the others, although loath to do so,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
took a final look at the new splendor, turned out
the light, locked the door and departed. Owen was
presented with a crisp dollar bill before they left,
however, and proceeded with his task of clearing
up most cheerfully. Still elatedly discussing the
success of the conspiracy, they made their way to
Miss Turner’s, nearby, left the key and started
homeward along Troutman Street. But at G Street
Morris called a halt.</p>

<p>“It’s only a quarter to eleven,” he said, “and
Castle’s is still open. What do you say if we walk
over there and celebrate?”</p>

<p>“It’s awfully late,” murmured Louise doubtfully,
“and I don’t believe mama would like it.”</p>

<p>But Nell Sawin declared that she didn’t care
whether folks liked it or not; she was going! “This
is an occasion,” she said, “and it simply demands
a celebration. I’ll go whether the rest do or not,
Morris!”</p>

<p>“We’ll all go,” said Gordon. “Come along,
Louise. There won’t be anyone there at this time
of night.” So Louise consented and they struck
across-town toward the Square.</p>

<p>“Look here,” said Morris presently, “we ought to
arrange some sort of a presentation, oughtn’t we?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
How’s Mr. Grayson going to know where the things
came from or who gave them? I wish we had
thought to ask Dick or Sears or some one to be on
hand and make a sort of speech.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you do it, Morris?” asked Nell.</p>

<p>“Me? Great Scott, no!”</p>

<p>“Then Gordon——”</p>

<p>“Nothing doing! Thank you just the same, Nell.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Louise. “We’ll write on a card
that the gift is made by the students and we’ll get
Miss Turner to let us in there early in the morning
and put it on the desk or somewhere where he will
see it. Won’t that do?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Morris. “What time does he usually
show up?”</p>

<p>“About a quarter of an hour before the bell,”
said Gordon. “There’ll be plenty of time. You
write it to-night, Louise, so you won’t forget it.”</p>

<p>“Very well. ‘To Mr. Grayson, from the Students
of the Clearfield High School, wishing him many
happy returns of the day.’ Would that do?”</p>

<p>“Slick,” said Morris, as they entered the drugstore.
“Now, then, what are you all going to have?”</p>

<p>There was a commendable promptness evident on
the part of a large portion of the students the next<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
morning. By eight o’clock the corridor was well
filled. The girls were somewhat in the majority,
for, as Gordon had surmised, many of the boys had
quite forgotten that the gift to which they subscribed
was to be presented to-day. Miss Turner arrived
soon after eight and smilingly fitted the key to the
office door. Louise slipped in and placed the card
she had written on the front of the desk, propping
it up with a stamp-box, while the others who had
arrived early to enjoy Mr. Grayson’s surprise
crowded about the doorway and exclaimed at what
they saw. All were not only delighted but quite
astonished at the beauty of the furnishings. “I
never supposed they’d be so lovely!” exclaimed one
girl as she tiptoed to see over the shoulders of
those in front of her. “Aren’t they just beautiful,
Miss Turner?” And Miss Turner, standing guard
at the door, smilingly agreed.</p>

<p>“It’s too bad,” said Morris, “that we couldn’t
have got the old things out of the way. He will
see them and know right off that something’s up.”</p>

<p>“But he won’t know what,” responded Toby
Sears. “Besides, if this mob stays here he won’t
be able to see the old furniture. It’s about time
he came, isn’t it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span></p>

<p>It was, and to prove it a small freshman who
had been detailed to watch for the Principal’s approach
from the entrance, came scuttling in with the
news. “He’s coming!” he shouted. “He’s coming!”</p>

<p>Miss Turner quickly closed and locked the door
and walked toward the entrance, whilst the others
scuttled away from the office but lingered in the
corridor, the girls doing a good deal of excited
giggling and the boys trying their best to appear
unconcerned. Then Mr. Grayson turned the corner
and a sudden silence reigned. Since by that time
nearly the entire student body was assembled, the
silence was distinctly strange and uncanny, and Mr.
Grayson evidently thought it so as, making his way
through the crowd, he gravely bowed and returned
the murmured greetings of the boys and girls. A
puzzled look appeared on his face and he bent frowning
glances right and left. Miss Turner intercepted
him half-way along the corridor.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Grayson,” she said casually, “here’s
your key.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, thank you. Ah—is there anything
wrong, Miss Turner?”</p>

<p>“Wrong?” asked the teacher in surprised tones.
“Why, no, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span></p>

<p>“Oh! I see! I thought—” He viewed the expectant
faces about him rather bewilderedly. “Thank
you, Miss Turner. Hm!”</p>

<p>He went on, the students crowding along the corridor
behind him, and fitted the key to the lock.
The throng hid the old furniture pushed against the
wall beyond the door and he caught no glimpse of
it. In fact, he scarcely looked that way, for he was
oddly embarrassed and wanted nothing but to put
his portal between him and the sea of strangely
staring faces. He turned the key and the knob and
quickly pushed the door open; and as quickly stepped
inside. And then, as though he had collided with an
invisible wall, he suddenly stood stock-still. There
was an expectant hush, broken at length by a nervous
giggle from some one of the girls. Those near the
office door saw the Principal’s head move as his
eyes swept the room. Then, his hand still on the
knob, he turned, plainly bewildered, as though he
suspected himself of being out of his mind, and
gazed helplessly and troubledly into the eager and
excited faces of the watchers.</p>

<p>“I—I don’t understand—” he faltered.</p>

<p>But realization came to him the next instant, for
the students, no longer able to stand the suspense,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
broke into applause. A wave of sound swept the
corridor; the clapping of hands, shouts, laughter
mingled in a confused babel, through which came
the piping cry of a small freshman:</p>

<p>“Happy birthday, sir!”</p>

<p>Mr. Grayson retreated before the outbreak,
amazement, relief, embarrassment struggling for
mastery. Uncertainly he laid his hat and gloves on
the desk, and in the act caught sight of the card. He
picked it up and read the inscription. It seemed to
take him a long time. Perhaps he couldn’t see very
well, for he removed his glasses, drew the silk
handkerchief from a pocket and began to rub the
lenses furiously. Then, pausing in that, he took up
the card once more and walked to the door and
through it to the corridor, the throng giving way
before him and the tumult increasing as those at
the far end of the corridor caught sight of him.
But gradually the noise ceased, and Mr. Grayson,
clearing his throat nervously, began to speak.</p>

<p>“Young ladies and gentlemen,” he said haltingly,
“I—this—” He stopped helplessly and shook his
head. “I’m too surprised to—to say what I’d like
to. I never guessed that—” He paused again, but
what it was he had never guessed they all understood.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
“I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
Not only for the—the wonderful gifts, but for the
kindness, the—the dearness, if I may say it, of your
action. It—it has affected me. That’s why you must
pardon me if I don’t express myself better. I can’t
find the words just now. I’m—I’m in a daze, I
think! Later, after I have had time to—to look
at all the beautiful things in there and to properly
appreciate what you have done I will try to thank
you as I should. All I can say now is that”—a
smile softened the grave lines of his face—“well,
that you’ve made this the happiest birthday I’ve ever
had!”</p>

<p>He bowed, tried to put his glasses in place again,
failed, and literally fled into the office. And then
the applause burst forth again, long and loud and
continued, and Toby Sears called for “a regular
cheer for Mr. Grayson, fellows, and make it good!”
And it was good! And in the very middle of it
the big gong clanged on the landing and, laughing
and happy, the throng dispersed to the various
rooms, more than one pair of eyes a little bit moist.
Louise, frankly tearful, declared that she didn’t
care! It had been perfectly beautiful!</p>

<p>Later in the day, in assembly hall, Mr. Grayson<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
thanked them again in a very nice speech, and even
made them laugh a little when he described the awed
condition in which he found himself amongst his
marvelous new possessions, but his first expression
of thanks down there in the crowded corridor had
told them far more eloquently of his feelings. At
recess those who had not viewed the new furnishings
visited the office and Mr. Grayson held a sort of
reception. The teachers, not to be entirely outdone,
had brought gifts as well. There was a new dictionary,
something very up-to-date and comprehensive
and extraordinarily bulky, with a stand to hold
it, and a big bunch of chrysanthemums on the desk.
And Mr. Grayson, grave but plainly proud and delighted,
exhibited each article of furniture to his
callers, and dwelt on the finish and the grain of
the wood and called attention to the coloring and
texture of the carpet and was quite boyishly excited.
Principal and pupils drew much closer together
that twenty-fifth of October than they ever
had been before. The girls declared that he was
“a perfect dear” and the boys, less willing to express
their real feelings, acknowledged one to another
that “he wasn’t a bad sort, Old Grayson!”</p>

<p>The mass-meeting and the birthday celebration<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
seemed to clear the atmosphere wonderfully and
an era of solidarity and good-feeling began at Clearfield
High School that endured a long time. Simultaneously,
Fortune smiled and two very satisfying
events occurred. One was the decision of the
Athletic Committee to devote the funds in hand
to the immediate repair of the athletic field. No
one ever knew for certain, but it was generally believed
that Mr. Grayson brought this about. It was
no secret that a meeting of the Committee was held
on Thursday at his desire and that he himself made
the motion and, in the discussion which followed,
supported it strongly, much to the surprise of the
student members. At all events, work on the fence
began Monday morning and it was announced that
a portion of the old stand would be demolished
and replaced by a new steel-trussed structure in
time for the Springdale game which was this year
played in Clearfield. Later, when more money
was available, another section would be erected.
If this was Mr. Grayson’s way of proving his
gratitude it was well appreciated by the whole
school.</p>

<p>The other event which brought satisfaction was
the victory on Saturday of the Varsity Football<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
Team over Benton School. As though to vindicate
themselves and their coach, the team scored
nineteen points against Benton and held that adversary
helpless. Still using a mere handful of
plays, none of them either novel or puzzling, Clearfield,
by working together with a precision that
promised fine things for the future, ripped the
Benton line almost at will and presented a defense
that anywhere inside the twenty-five-yard line was
invulnerable. Morris Brent played through a full
quarter and, although no field-goals were necessary,
demonstrated his value to the backfield by excellent
punting and good rushing. Clearfield went quite
wild over that victory, for Benton had a big, well-trained
and hard-fighting team, and had, only the
week before, played Springdale to a standstill,
neither side being able to score. Even the news
that Springdale had overwhelmingly beaten Nickerson
that afternoon failed to disturb Clearfield’s
satisfaction, although it did give Dick subject for
thought. Nickerson was believed to be fairly strong
and Springdale had, by reason of injuries to several
of her best players, gone into the fray with a line-up
largely substitute. Dick waited impatiently for
the Monday morning Springdale paper, and when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
it came could find but slight encouragement in the
account of the game it contained. There was no
denying that this year’s Springdale team was one
to be respected. The conference that Monday
evening lasted long.</p>

that when, when the old chap—Middleton, I mean,
the millionaire that was found murdered——”</p>

<p>“I remember,” replied Dick, opening a sandwich
to examine the contents.</p>

<p>“Well, ‘Young Sleuth’ discovers that when Middleton
was a young man, before he made all his
money, he was a member of a band of Nihilists.”</p>

<p>“Nihilists?” queried Dick doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Well, Socialists, I guess. Anyway, they used to
meet in a cellar and plot. And it turns out that
Middleton was stung with the job to kill a man.
They’d draw lots, you know, and one time he drew
the piece of paper that had the black dagger on it,
and that meant that he was the goat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t see the connection between a black dagger
and a goat,” demurred Dick gravely.</p>

<p>“Sure! The one who drew the paper with the
black dagger on it had to do the deed. See? And
Middleton drew it. The man he was to kill was a
Governor of a State, you see. He’d been doing
things these Socialists didn’t like. So they decided
to kill him.”</p>

<p>“Quite simple,” observed Dick. “Did Whathisname
do it?”</p>

<p>“No. That’s the point. He started to, and once
he almost did it, but something happened. Then he
fell in love with the Governor’s daughter and they
got married and went to Europe to live because the
Socialists were mad at him for not killing the Governor,
and put a price on his head.”</p>

<p>“How much?” asked Dick interestedly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Fudge. “That’s just a
figure of speech. So he lived over in Europe for a
long time till he thought the Socialists had forgotten
their grouch and then came back to this country
and made his fortune.”</p>

<p>“How’d he do it?” inquired Dick.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” said the narrator a trifle impatiently.
“He was a Magnate. Anyhow, the Socialists<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
hadn’t forgotten him at all, and every now
and then they tried to kill him, do you see. Well,
that’s the clue ‘Young Sleuth’ discovers, and so he
tracks the Socialists and goes to one of their meetings
in disguise and they find he’s a spy and he has
a terrible time getting away from them with his life.
I haven’t got that far yet, though. I’m where he
has just discovered about the Socialists. I’ve got
eight chapters done.”</p>

<p>“Fine,” said Dick, folding his collapsible lunchbox.
“How about the movie play, though? Done
anything with that yet?”</p>

<p>“N-no, I thought I’d better finish the story first
and then dramatize it afterwards. That’s the way
they generally do it. Maybe I won’t make it into
a play at all, though. I read the other day that they
don’t pay much for them. I guess I’ll have it published
in a book first, anyway, wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Dick a trifle absent-mindedly.
“Look here, Fudge, you seem an inventive sort of
chap. Why don’t you get your brains to working
for the team?”</p>

<p>“How do you mean, team?” asked Fudge inelegantly.</p>

<p>“I mean try your hand at inventing a couple of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
good plays for us, Fudge. Ever try that sort of
thing?”</p>

<p>Fudge shook his head. “No. You mean trick
plays?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly. Leave the ‘tricks’ out of them.
Just a good play that will put the man with the ball
where he can gain through the other fellow’s line,
or around it, Fudge. Imagine you’re the quarterback
and want a score like anything. Locate the
opposing players and then scheme to get through
them. You know your rules, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Y-yes, I guess so. Most of ’em, Dick. What—what
kind of a play would you want?”</p>

<p>“A play that’ll gain ground. Any kind of a play
that we can use, Fudge. I don’t know that you’ll
have any luck, but it occurred to me that if you
could apply some of the ingenuity you display in
writing these stories of yours to the problem of devising
a play to use against Springdale you might
hit on something.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind trying it,” said Fudge with growing
interest. “You have to have a checker-board and
checkers, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe those things are absolutely necessary,”
answered the coach, with a smile. “Take a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
block of paper and a pencil. After you’ve doped
something out, study it hard. See if it’s against
the rules and whether it’s calculated to deceive the
enemy. Remember that the one big rule is to bunch
your strength at the opponent’s weakest point. No
matter how you do it, that’s the thing, Fudge. Start
with that in mind and work from it. When you’ve
got anything that looks good to you on paper bring
it along and I’ll see what it looks like to me. If it
seems promising we’ll try it out in practice. What
do you say?”</p>

<p>“Sure! I don’t mind. I’ll do some to-night.
That story can wait a while, I guess. Anyhow, it—it’s
getting sort of hard to write. I dare say it
will go easier if I rest-off a bit. The trouble with
these detective stories is that they’re—they’re complicated!
Take this Socialist business, Dick. A
fellow has to study up a lot, you know. That’s one
reason I thought of having them Nihilists instead.
A Nihilist——”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you call them Anarchists, Fudge?”</p>

<p>“Gee! That’s it!” Fudge smote his knee delightedly.
“That’s what I had in mind all the time, but
I couldn’t think of the word! Anarchists! That’s
what they were! You don’t have to study about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
them, either. Every fellow knows what they are.
But Socialists——”</p>

<p>The gong announcing the termination of recess
broke in on Fudge’s remarks and the two got up
from the coping and hurried back to school.</p>

<p>“Tell you what you do, Fudge,” said Dick, with
a smile. “You make believe that the other team
are the Anarchists and that this ‘Young Sleuth’ is
the quarterback on your eleven. That’ll lend a certain
romantic interest to the thing, and I guess you
have to have that to bring out your best efforts.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea,” commended Fudge interestedly.
“I’ll bet you if ‘Young Sleuth’ had been
a quarterback he’d have shown some slick work!”</p>

<p>It was the last day of October, and but two
games remained on Clearfield’s schedule before the
final contest; that with Lesterville four days hence
and one with Weston Academy a week later. The
High School graduates had failed to get a team
together and George Cotner had fortunately secured
Weston for the date. Weston, the team which
Lanny and Chester Cottrell had seen in action at
Springdale, promised to give Clearfield just the sort
of a battle needed in its final stage of preparation,
one which, while not too strenuous, would thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
test out its defensive strength against open
plays. Weston, too, had been left without a game
on the eleventh of November, and was very glad to
accept Cotner’s offer of the date.</p>

<p>Secret practice began the following day and
Clearfield was set the task of learning a new formation
and a number of plays from it. Dick now considered
that the team was well enough versed in the
fundamentals, although more than once in the ensuing
two weeks of practice fellows were sent back
to the dummy or drilled in other rudimentary
branches when they showed signs of forgetting their
a, b, c’s. Dick had not yet attempted to develop the
attack beyond what might be required of it from
week to week. He had spent the first six weeks of
the season in grounding the players in elementary
football, in developing what he called the wits of the
fellows—by which he meant the ability to think
quickly in all sorts of situations and act accordingly—and
in securing coherence. There had been a
period when every fellow played for himself, a later
period when the line and the backfield played as
though they were in no way related, and now there
had come a third stage of development in which
the entire team of eleven men played together. Absolute<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
perfection of team-play was still lacking, and
Dick was satisfied that it should be, for he was convinced
that no football team ever reached the top-notch
of excellence and stayed there twenty-four
hours. Dick believed that the team which attained
the height of its season’s form to-day began to go
back to-morrow, and his biggest fear was that Clearfield
High School would reach the zenith of development
too early. His ambition, in short, was to
trot the Purple on to the field on the eighteenth of
November ready to play as it had not played all the
Fall and as it could not play the day after. How
nearly he would succeed in realizing that ambition
remained to be seen.</p>

<p>While he had not yet paid much attention to
offense, an offense had developed naturally on the
groundwork he had prepared, an offense which,
found wanting in several contests, had come into its
own in the Benton game. With the defense, however,
Dick had started early, since, when all is said,
a good defense is harder to construct than a good
attack. Consequently the team’s offense was a full
fortnight behind its defense, and offensively and
defensively both it was far more backward than
Springdale. Dick, though, was not worrying about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
that. It was his theory that Springdale had been
developed too early and was likely to reach its top
form at least a week before its principal game.</p>

<p>The new attack formation—now known as Formation
B—was introduced to the Varsity on the
Wednesday before the Lesterville contest. It was
designed to conceal the play until the last possible
moment and required only slight shifts of the backfield
before the ball was snapped. A close line of
seven players was used. The left halfback stood behind
left guard and some two yards back, the right
half in a corresponding position on the other side,
the quarterback stood three yards directly behind
center and the fullback stood three yards farther
back of quarter. From this formation plunges at
any position, and runs, forward passes, lateral passes
and punts could be got off without enough shifting
to appraise the opponent of the character or point of
attack. The center usually passed direct to the
runner. The feature that was most important in
Dick’s eyes, however, was that it not only concealed
a punt but protected the punter. Fullback had only
to drop back another step or two and quarter need
only jump to the right out of the path of the ball
to convert a rushing to a kicking formation. To<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
add to the deception, these slight shifts need not be
followed by a punt. A fullback run around either
end or a forward pass might follow, or the ball at
the last moment might be snapped to either of the
other three backs. The formation had promised well
on paper and by Thursday it had proved itself.</p>

<p>Dick’s campaign was built around Morris Brent
to a large degree. Dick did not believe that his team
was sufficiently powerful in rushing ability to gain
with certainty through the Springdale line inside
the latter’s twenty yards. Nor, while he looked for
some success with forward and lateral passing, did
he expect to be able to cross the opponent’s goal line
by that style of play. It was Morris’s drop-kicking
he was counting on inside the enemy’s twenty-yard
line, and there appeared to be no good reason why
that accomplished young gentleman should disappoint
him. Morris was now taking his regular
amount of work and had been making seven and
eight goals out of ten in practice and in scrimmage
with the Scrubs. What might happen, though, if
Morris went stale before the game or had an off-day
on the eighteenth, Dick hated to think!</p>

<p>He did not flatter himself that his plan was a
secret from the enemy, for Springdale well knew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
Morris’s kicking powers and knew that he was as
good as ever, in spite of his accident in the Summer.
The only deception Dick could hope to indulge in
was that of concealing his plays until the moment
came to strike. Once inside the Springdale twenty-yard
line, Clearfield would be expected to try for a
field-goal unless, which was not at all likely, she
found herself able to rush the ball over for a score.
Springdale had twice sent scouts to watch her opponent
play, a proceeding which had visibly annoyed
George Cotner, who had never become reconciled
to Dick’s and Lanny’s “no scouting” edict.
However, it is doubtful if the Springdale spies discovered
anything of use to their team. On one
occasion they had seen Clearfield beaten by Corwin
and on the other had watched the Purple capture
the Benton contest by the use of the most elemental
plays.</p>

<p>Springdale herself had come through a successful
season, meeting with but one defeat and one tie.
She was due for a hard game next Saturday, but,
after that, like Clearfield, she was opposed to a
team which was likely to afford her only a good
stiff practice. One point there was on which Dick
had finally satisfied himself. Springdale was without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
the services of a player who could be relied on
to score by goals from the field. An excellent punter
she did have; two, in fact; but a drop-kicker was
not included in her assets. Springdale, in a word,
was counting on a victory to be secured by all-around
superiority of line and backfield and not by
the individual efforts of any one star. Dick often
wished that he, too, was able to pin his faith on a
powerful attack that would win through the opponent’s
line. The trouble with depending on a single
individual to win a share at least of the points was
that if anything happened to the individual either
before or during the game the fat was in the fire!
Consequently, he watched after Morris like a mother
hen protecting a lone chick, and sometimes ruefully
told himself that he was unwisely banking too much
for success on one boy’s right leg! If anything
happened to that leg——</p>

<p>But Dick refused to dwell on that contingency.
He couldn’t afford to and keep his wits about him!</p>

<p>On Saturday the Varsity, twenty-five strong, journeyed
to Lesterville in a special pumpkin-hued trolley-car
and engaged in the last hard game before
the final test.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX<br />
<small>MORRIS CALLS IN THE DOCTOR</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Nearly the entire school accompanied the
team to Lesterville. The distance was short
and the journey could be made inexpensively
on the trolley line. Besides, football enthusiasm
was by now rampant. The Benton victory
had rekindled dampened patriotism and the yellow-sided
cars which sped across country in the wake of
the Varsity’s special were filled to the limit with excited
and noisy partisans. Lesterville was a manufacturing
town and the Lesterville High School had
an unfortunate but not undeserved reputation for
roughness in its athletic contests. Dick, who had
conducted the baseball team there in the summer,
recalled the unpleasantness that had occurred on
that occasion and hoped that to-day’s meeting would
pass without similar incident. He looked for a victory,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
in spite of the fact that they had agreed not to
have recourse to either the new formation or to any
of the plays which had been designed for Springdale’s
special benefit. If they could win with the old
plays—and both Dick and Lanny believed they
could—well and good; otherwise there would be another
defeat chalked up against Clearfield’s record.</p>

<p>When Lesterville kicked off at the start of the
game the Purple presented Merrick at left end, Partridge
at left tackle, Cable at left guard, Haley at
center, A. Beaton at right guard, Wayland at right
tackle, Felker at right end, Cottrell at quarter, White
at left half, Hansard at right half and N. Beaton at
full. With the exception of the right halfback position,
the line-up was the best Clearfield could put
into the field, unless, having in mind Morris Brent’s
kicking ability, we give him the call over Nelson
Beaton at fullback. Beaton, however, hit the line
harder than Morris and was more clever in a broken
field, and it was probable that in the Springdale
game he would be used throughout the first half as
long as Lanny and Cottrell made good with their
punting or unless a field-goal became necessary.</p>

<p>Lesterville lined up a big, powerful-looking lot of
players and it soon became evident to the visiting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
contingent that Clearfield would not find it an easy
matter to gain through the line. Her first attempts
ended disastrously and Chester Cottrell punted on
third down. A big, rangy Lesterville back pulled
the ball down and came charging back with it, eluding
tacklers until he had raced over four white
marks. Even then it required the combined services
of Lanny and Hansard to stop him. Lesterville
started at once on a series of plays on tackle that
proved good for two and three-yard gains. The
fullback, standing two paces behind center, took the
ball direct and slammed at Partridge or Wayland
and seemed always to find a hole on one side or the
other. Lesterville marched down into Clearfield
territory before the latter solved that attack, simple
as it was. Then Cottrell closed his line and dropped
his ends back and Lesterville found the going harder.
Finally, transferring her attention to the center of
the line, she was halted on the twenty-eight yards
and forced to kick. A short punt across the field
was captured by Cottrell, and that youth punted on
first down from his five-yard line, the ball going to
midfield. Lesterville got off a short forward pass
that just failed of giving her her distance and followed
it with a fierce attack on the center. A penalty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
for off-side set her back and, after another attempt
at a forward pass, which grounded, she punted
to Clearfield’s twenty-three. There Hansard caught
and, with good interference, ran back nearly to midfield.
With N. Beaton and Lanny alternating,
Clearfield secured first down on plunges between
guards, a fake-kick play fooling the opponent badly.
Lesterville was set back five yards for holding. Cottrell,
on a quarterback run, squirmed outside of
tackle for four yards, Beaton plunged at right guard
for two more and Lanny made the distance on a
run outside left tackle. A second attempt at the
same wing netted two, a plunge at center was
thrown back and Cottrell passed forward to Merrick
for seven. Beaton gained two through left guard.
With the ball near her thirty yards, Lesterville tightened
and after two attempts which gained but half
the distance Clearfield punted across the line.</p>

<p>Merrick was off-side on the next scrimmage and
Clearfield was set back. Lesterville worked a double
pass and gained six around Merrick’s end. On the
fourth down, with half a yard to go, the Lesterville
quarter fumbled and the ball went to the Purple.
Lanny got away around left end for seven, Beaton
made two through right guard and Lanny shot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
around right end for four. He was roughly tackled
and Clearfield called for time while he got his breath
back. The pigskin was now on Lesterville’s fourteen
yards and the Clearfield partisans were demanding
a touchdown. A forward pass, Beaton to Felker,
from kick formation, gained five yards, Felker being
tackled on the side line and thrown out. Time was
again called, the right end having had most of his
breath knocked out of him. From the nine-yard line
Lanny dashed around left end for a scant yard and
placed the pigskin in front of goal. Morris Brent
replaced Beaton at fullback. A fake kick, Hansard
carrying the ball, gained two yards off left tackle,
and on fourth down, with two to go, Haley snapped
to Morris who lifted the ball over the cross-bar
from the twenty-yard line. Clearfield 3; Lesterville
0. The quarter ended after the kick-off, the
ball down on Clearfield’s eighteen yards.</p>

<p>Dick took Morris Brent out and put Nelson
Beaton back. Several of the Clearfield players
showed signs of wear, but there were no serious injuries.
The second period was all Lesterville’s, for
Clearfield lost the ball on a fumble by Hansard soon
after the quarter started and the adversary recovered
it on the Purple’s fifteen-yard line. Lesterville in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
the stand and around the field shouted delightedly
as the big fullback plunged straight through Haley
for half the distance to goal. A second attempt at
the center, however, gained less than a yard, and
the Lesterville left half fell back as if to try a drop-kick.
Clearfield, though, was not to be fooled and
the quick plunge by right half at the left of the line
was stopped for no gain. This time, on the fourth
down, the ball really went back to the kicker, but
the pass was low and the ball failed to go over the
bar.</p>

<p>Clearfield failed to gain, with Lanny carrying the
ball, around her left end and Cottrell punted. The
ball went high and was caught on Clearfield’s thirty-four
yards. From there, by means of a forward pass
which gained twelve yards straight across the middle
of the line, and attacks between guards, Lesterville
worked back to the Purple’s twelve yards. A penalty
for holding set her back fifteen. A forward
pass failed and a double-pass behind the line netted
four yards. Then a skin-tackle play got through
for four more and a massed attack at center gave
the enemy first down on Clearfield’s eleven yards.
Again, however, Clearfield dug her toes and repelled
three attempts for a total loss of five yards, and once<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
more Lesterville attempted a goal from the field,
and once more a poor pass upset her calculations.
This time the ball bounded back from a charging
Clearfield lineman and the Lesterville quarter fell on
it on the Purple’s twenty-three yards. A fake-kick
followed by a run around the left of her line brought
Lesterville to the fifteen. A forward pass was tried,
but Clearfield spoiled it. A plunge at Haley gained
a yard and Lesterville sent her left half into kicking
position. The pass was again too low and the
line failed to hold and the left half hurled the ball
across the field to an end. Gordon Merrick put the
end out, however, and the pigskin grounded and
went to Clearfield. The latter’s attempts to circle
the ends gained little, as did a plunge at the center,
and Cottrell punted to the enemy’s forty-five-yard
line. The Lesterville quarter was downed for no
gain. Lesterville plugged the line again and the
half ended with the ball in her possession on the
Purple’s thirty-two yards.</p>

<p>Haley, Cable and Hansard had been pretty
roughly used, the latter having sustained a strained
ankle. Dick substituted Brimmer at center, Robey
at left guard and McCoy at right half. Tupper was
recovering from an injured knee sustained in practice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
and Dick was loath to risk him. The third quarter
began well for the visiting team, for a fumble on
her twenty-four yards lost Lesterville possession of
the ball. Cottrell sent Lanny at left guard and
gained three yards and then hurled the ball across to
Merrick, who had got free. But the throw was too
short and lost a down. A delayed pass to McCoy
opened a hole at center and McCoy got through for
four. Beaton went back as if to punt and Cottrell
dashed straight ahead for the remaining distance.
Beaton, however, was hurt, a Lesterville player having
charged into him rather more roughly than the
occasion demanded, and had to retire. Lanny drew
the umpire’s attention to the offense, but that official
claimed not to have witnessed it. Morris Brent took
Beaton’s place.</p>

<p>With the ball on the home team’s thirteen yards,
Morris went back to kicking position and Cottrell
skirted the left end for two yards, being downed
near the side line. A criss-cross, with the ball going
to McCoy, lost three, and again Morris went back.
But once more the play was a fake; and Lanny got
five yards past right tackle. On fourth down there
was still four to go and Morris stationed himself on
the twenty-yard line. Brimmer, however, passed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
miserably and the ball struck the ground a yard in
front of the fullback. Morris got it on the bound
but it was then too late to kick. Eluding one of the
opposing ends who had almost reached him, Morris
dashed away toward the left of his line. Lanny
ran with him and put out one of the enemy. But
Morris found no chance to turn in and was finally
brought down on the ten-yard line by a terrific tackle
that left him half-stunned. Time was called and
Lanny again appealed to the officials. But neither
umpire nor referee would allow that the tackle had
been unfair. Morris, groaning with pain, pointed to
his leg and Dick’s heart sank. Quickly he was lifted
up and carried off the field and Abbey, a third-string
substitute, was put in his place.</p>

<p>Lesterville got her backs working finely and
forced her opponent back into her own territory before
the tide turned. Then a penalty for off-side
and a signal that went wrong necessitated a punt
and the ball again changed hands. But there was
no further threatening of either goal and the quarter
ended.</p>

<p>In the fourth period young Hull went in for Cottrell,
Bryan took Merrick’s place, Felker gave way
to Toll and A. Beaton to Kent. With eight substitutes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
in the line-up, things looked bright for Lesterville.
But Lesterville, too, had been forced to
make some changes, and the teams which battled
through the final fifteen minutes proved, after all,
very evenly matched. The new linemen gave good
accounts of themselves and Perry Hull ran the eleven
brilliantly. The playing, which had slowed down in
the third quarter, was speeded up again and it was
soon seen that Clearfield was getting the jump on
her opponent. Hull mixed his plays well and at the
end of five minutes Clearfield was once more knocking
at the enemy’s portal. But, although, she managed
to get the pigskin to the eight yards, there was
no one to try a field-goal and Hull’s attempt at a
forward pass over the line failed. Lesterville worked
back to midfield, was held there and tried a forward
pass which McCoy captured. Another slow but certain
advance toward the Lesterville goal reached the
twenty-yard line. There a fumble lost the Purple
possession of the ball and Lesterville punted on second
down. Hull caught and wormed his way past
the enemy for fifteen yards. A forward pass gained
twelve yards and first down. McCoy battered his
way through for eight and Lanny gained the rest.
The ball was back on the opponent’s eighteen yards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
again and Clearfield cheered madly and shouted
“Touchdown!” at the top of her lungs. But the
Purple was playing against time now and there was
but a scant two minutes left. Lanny struck the left
of the line for a slight gain and got so roughly
treated that time was called while he was taken out,
remonstrating, and Tupper put in. Another attempt
at the right of the line by McCoy gained three and
then Tupper was given a chance to show what Morris’s
teaching had done for him. But although Brimmer
managed to pass fairly well and the Purple line
held like a wall, Tupper’s drop-kick went two yards
wide of the goal and Lesterville fell on it for a touchback.
Then, after one scrimmage, the whistle
shrilled and the game was over, Clearfield the victor
by one goal from the field.</p>

<p>Clearfield at large was well enough satisfied with
that result, in spite of the fact that several of the
players were suffering minor injuries which would
keep them out of practice for several days. For it
was realized that not only had Coach Lovering used
many substitutes but that he had succeeded in winning
without divulging a single new play, which,
since rumor had it that Springdale scouts had been
seen there that afternoon, was considered a fine bit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
of fortune. But Dick himself was far from satisfied
with the way things had turned out, although he kept
that dissatisfaction to himself. He and Morris Brent
were both pretty uncommunicative on the trip back.
They sat together, with George Cotner on Morris’s
other side, and, although Morris summoned a smile
when fellows asked how he felt, an attentive study
of his countenance might have revealed the fact that
his cheerfulness was assumed and that all the way
back to Clearfield he was suffering pain. And although
when they changed cars at Town Square
Morris managed to walk without much wincing it
was seen that Dick and George Cotner helped him in
and out of the cars. At the corner of E and Sawyer
Streets they alighted, now, since the other fellows
were no longer present, attempting no disguise of the
effort it cost the injured boy to get from the car to
the sidewalk. Dick hurried around up E Street to
his house and was soon back with Eli. Into the runabout
Morris was assisted, George Cotner drew back
and Eli jogged slowly and carefully out Sawyer
Street toward Brentwood. For a block or two the
occupants of the car were silent. Then it was Morris
who spoke:</p>

<p>“Of all the rotten luck!” he declared bitterly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span></p>

<p>Dick nodded. “It’s tough,” he agreed grimly.
“I’m awfully sorry, Morris.”</p>

<p>“The silly doctor told me it was just as good as
the other one, too! A fat lot he knows about it!
What do you suppose I’ve done to it, Dick?”</p>

<p>Dick shook his head helplessly. “I don’t know,
Morris. I couldn’t find anything like a break. Maybe
it’s just a wrench, after all.”</p>

<p>“Gee, I hope so!” muttered the other. “I don’t
see how it happened, anyway, do you? He tackled
me all right, didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“He tackled below your knees,” answered Dick
grimly. “I could see that, even if the umpire
couldn’t. I suppose when you went down you
twisted the leg somehow. Well, it’s done now. I’m
sorry for you, Morris, and I’m sorry for the team.
It leaves us in a hole, all right. We’ve been counting
on you all Fall, you see, and we’ve built our
game around you. I don’t suppose Tupper——”</p>

<p>“He’s not much good,” Morris growled. “He
doesn’t seem to get any swing at the ball. Hang it
all, Dick, I’ve <em>got</em> to play! That’s all there is about
it! If that fool doctor says I can’t I—I’ll tell him
to forget it!”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid your folks won’t forget it, though,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
replied Dick dryly. “There’s just one thing to do,
Morris.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Morris, groaning as the car
went over a jounce.</p>

<p>“Keep it quiet,” answered Dick. “None of the fellows
know that you’re badly hurt—if you are, of
course—and it mustn’t get around. Springdale must
think we’ve still got you to kick field-goals. We can
fake along somehow, Morris. The doctor will let
you come out in togs and sit on the bench, anyway,
I guess, and maybe you can trot about a bit.”</p>

<p>“Don’t see what good that’ll do if I can’t play,”
objected the other dejectedly.</p>

<p>“It’ll do some good, Morris. We’ll have to change
our plans for the Springdale game, but we needn’t let
Springdale know we’ve changed them. See?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” muttered Morris thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Now, when you get home you telephone for the
doctor at once and get his verdict. But swear him
to secrecy, Morris, and swear everyone of your folks
to secrecy too. Then call me up and tell me what
he says. No, don’t say anything over the ’phone but
‘yes’ or ‘no.’ If you say ‘no’ I’ll know you can’t play.
But don’t let a soul hear about it. If you can hobble
out on Monday I’ll come for you in the car.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
I want the paper to report you at practice. I want
Springdale to keep right on thinking that we’re
banking on you for field-goals, Morris. I’m not
going to lie about it, but I’m certainly not going to
put anyone wise. See what I mean?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I see what you mean, all right. But—but,
hang it, Dick, it doesn’t do me any good!”</p>

<p>“It’ll do you a lot of good if you see us win from
Springdale instead of lose to her two weeks from
to-day,” replied Dick. “It’s the one way, I guess,
in which you can help us to win now, Morris. Remember
that.”</p>

<p>“All right, Dick. Anyway, maybe it won’t be as
bad as we think. Maybe if I keep out of it a few
days I’ll be all right.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see,” said the other. “Now I’ll give you
an arm into the house. Stay where you are till I
get out.” Dick looked cautiously about and was relieved
to find the street deserted. “All right now.
Put your arm over my shoulders. That’s the ticket!
Hurt much?”</p>

<p>“Not—not much,” answered Morris from between
clenched teeth.</p>

<p>Three-quarters of an hour later Dick left the supper
table to answer the telephone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span></p>

<p>“That you, Dick?” asked a voice at the other end
of the wire.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Dick.</p>

<p>“This is Morris.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“He says——”</p>

<p>“Never mind that! Careful, Morris! Is it ‘yes’
or ‘no’?”</p>

<p>There was a fateful pause. Then:</p>

<p>“‘No,’” growled the voice.</p>

<small>THE NEW PLAYS ARE TRIED</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The football council, or board of strategy, as
George Cotner liked to call it, met at Dick’s
house Sunday night. Gordon, who had
dropped around to call, was included. Lanny, Chester
Cottrell and Cotner were the other members.
None save Dick knew of Morris’s injury until Dick
made it known. Then consternation indeed did
reign.</p>

<p>“Do you mean,” demanded Lanny, “that he won’t
be able to play at all against Springdale?”</p>

<p>“The doctor forbids it. The leg isn’t broken anywhere,
but it’s had a bad wrench and Morris says he
simply laughed at him when he asked if it would be
well enough by the eighteenth for him to play. He’s
on his back to-day and must stay there until Tuesday
at least. I went around there this afternoon.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
Morris isn’t—” Dick smiled slightly—“isn’t awfully
cheerful company just now!”</p>

<p>“But—but that puts us in a beast of a hole!” exclaimed
Lanny. “Can Tupper kick a goal if he has
a chance?”</p>

<p>“The best Tupper has done is something like four
out of ten tries from around the twenty-yard line
and at almost no angle. I think by next year George
will be a fairly good drop-kicker, but there isn’t
much hope for this year. Of course, we’ll keep him
at it and make him do the best he can, but there’s
no use counting on him much in the Springdale
game, fellows.”</p>

<p>Lanny laughed mirthlessly. “Pleasant news, isn’t
it?” he asked of the assemblage. “It might save us
trouble to forfeit the game.”</p>

<p>“We’re not beaten yet,” responded Dick. “Besides
you chaps and me and the doctor, no one knows
of this; excepting Morris’s folks, of course, and
they, as well as the doctor, have been sworn to secrecy.
Now I want you fellows to agree not to
breathe a word of it to anyone; not to even talk of
it amongst yourselves.”</p>

<p>They each nodded, looking, however, rather
mystified.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span></p>

<p>“There’s just one thing left to do,” continued
Dick. “We’ve got to change the campaign. We’ve
planned around Morris’s drop-kicking and place-kicking;
we’ve got to plan now on a rushing game.
But Springdale knows that we’ve got Morris Brent
to put the ball over for us from anywhere inside the
twenty yards, and Springdale doesn’t look for us to
try to rush it over if the going’s tough. Once inside
her twenty she will expect a try-at-goal. Our one
hope lies in allowing her to continue thinking that.
That’s why this has got to be kept quiet, fellows. If
she gets news of it she’ll know too much. Just as
soon as Morris is able to get out he will put togs on
and report every afternoon. Since practice is secret
no one will know that he isn’t playing. I shall tell
every member of both teams to-morrow that anyone
giving out a particle of news will be dropped at once.
In the Weston game I’ll have Morris show himself
on the field. The same any time we hold open practice.
No one need know of this except ourselves.”</p>

<p>“But if we don’t use him in the Springdale game
won’t they guess?” asked Gordon.</p>

<p>“They’ll worry,” replied Dick calmly. “I
wouldn’t be surprised if Morris sitting in plain sight
on the bench was as much use to us as though he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
played. For that matter, if the right conditions
arrive I mean to put him in.”</p>

<p>“In spite of the doctor?” gasped Chester.</p>

<p>“No, I’ll get the doctor’s permission for Morris
to go in <em>if he doesn’t play</em>!”</p>

<p>“If he doesn’t play? Then what—” Lanny, pausing,
viewed Dick with dawning comprehension.
Then he grunted. “I see. There might be something
in that at a pinch.”</p>

<p>“And I’m afraid the pinch is going to come,”
said Dick grimly.</p>

<p>“I don’t see,” began Cotner.</p>

<p>“I’m not ready to explain just yet,” Dick interrupted.
“I’ll have to work it out. Later I’ll have
something to suggest. Morris is still an asset, even
if he can’t play, and we’ve got to find a way to
use him. Now, then, let’s see if we can plan out
a game that will win without any field-goals.
My conviction is that near Springdale’s goal we
won’t be able to smash that line of theirs much.
So we’ve got to find a way of getting around it or
a way of opening it up. <a href="#i_272fp">Here are some plays I’ve
been working on.</a> I want to see what you think
of them.” Dick took up a half-dozen sheets of paper.
“These are all from B formation. I think we will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
stick to that formation on attack right through, fellows.
I don’t believe that anything is to be gained
by using the other at times. Formation A won’t
allow any play that B won’t, and the fewer things
we have to remember, the better. Now, here’s a forward
pass from kick formation. Beaton falls back
to punting distance, you hold your place, Lanny,
Chester jumps to the right out of the way of the
pass and Tupper holds his place too. You and Tupper
and Chester are in position to protect the kicker
and so far there’s nothing to give it away. The ends
go down as if under the punt, right end wheeling
toward the center after getting by and left keeping
out toward the side line. The ball is passed to Beaton
and he fakes a kick and then runs, not too fast, to
the right about ten paces and throws to right end,
if he is uncovered. If not, then to Tupper, who,
after blocking and letting his man by on the inside,
runs straight out to the right. You, Chester, protect
the throw from here, just in front of Beaton. We’ve
got to get the time right in this play. About ten
counts should see everyone set for the throw; perhaps
eight; we’ll have to work that out in practice.
The same play can be used on the weak side. In that
case Beaton would run to the left, you following<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
him, Chester, and Lanny running out to the side to
take the throw in case left end isn’t uncovered. I’m
going to number this 8 on the right and 9 on the
left. What do you think of it?”</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_272fp">
  <img src="images/i_272fp.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="noic"><a href="#Page_272">“‘Here are some plays I’ve been working on.’”</a></p></div>
</div>

<p>There were some criticisms, Lanny pointing out
that there might be danger from the enemy’s right
wing coming through. This was discussed and
finally the play was set aside for trial. Dick next
presented a delayed pass from kick formation with
left end coming around and taking the ball from
quarter. This promised a good variation of an old
play and Chester was enthusiastic over it. Three
other plays followed: a delayed pass with fullback
taking the ball for a plunge at center, a rather complicated
lateral pass in which the entire backfield participated,
and a simple tackle-around play with an
end participating. All were decided to be worth
trying out against the Scrubs. Finally Saturday’s
game came up for discussion and criticism, and,
after that had been thoroughly threshed out, the subject
of injuries was brought up. Only Nelson Beaton
had suffered more than superficially. He was
pretty well bruised, Lanny reported. It was decided
to excuse all players who had gone through three
periods on Saturday from to-morrow’s practice. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
was almost eleven o’clock when the conference broke
up, and after the others had gone Dick remained
until nearly midnight at the parlor table. Once he
took up a blue-book, fourteen of whose thirty-two
pages were decorated with weird plans from the
brain of Fudge Shaw, and examined the contents
attentively. But in the end he laid it down with a
sigh. Fudge’s plays were all old, true and tried. He
had utterly failed to show any of that ingenuity
which he lavished on his stories, Dick reflected.
After that he took up his own plays and studied
them frowningly, seeking to discover the weak
points in each. Later still, he put his hands behind
his head, leaned back in his chair and gazed tiredly
and discouragedly at the green-shaded lamp. In
spite of his hopeful attitude before the others, he was
in reality pretty low in spirits to-night. It was, he
told himself ruefully, all very well to talk glibly of
changing the plan of battle at the eleventh hour, but
would any new plan work out? As matters stood
now Springdale possessed a stronger and much
heavier line, an equally fast and slightly heavier
backfield and an equally good punting department.
She was trained by an experienced coach who had
been with the team for several years and who had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
previously shown himself remarkably clever at devising
new plays for his men. On the whole, Clearfield’s
outlook was rather depressing to-night, and
Clearfield’s coach, when, finally, he put out the lamp,
locked up the house and went to bed, was far from
hopeful.</p>

<p>But morning always brings new courage, and
Monday morning made no exception in Dick’s case.
The sun shone radiantly, there was a pleasant crispness
in the breeze which blew through his window
and things looked a heap better to him, although,
actually, conditions had not changed a bit since midnight!
At breakfast he neglected his eggs while he
searched anxiously through the Springdale paper for
its account of the Clearfield and Lesterville game.
And when he had read it he sighed his satisfaction.
Not a word was said about Morris’s injury. That
incident had gone unnoticed, or so it appeared.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Lesterville, Nov. 4: [he read] Clearfield High School
won an interesting and closely contested game from the
home team here this afternoon, 3–0. The visitors
showed more team-play and were better able to gain
outside of tackles. Neither team had enough punch to
put the ball over the line, Clearfield making the only
score by a field-goal in the first period, Brent kicking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
from the twenty-yard line. Nothing new in plays was
shown by either team. For Lesterville, Norris, fullback,
played a fine game and Purdy, at quarter, ran the team
well. Lesterville’s line was slow and the opponent owed
many of her gains to the fact. For Clearfield, Captain
White played his usually brilliant game and was well
assisted by Hansard and N. Beaton, and, later, by Brent,
who went in for Beaton. Many substitutes were used
on both sides.</p>
</div>

<p>The local paper, which gave nearly a half column
to the event, mentioned the injury to Morris, but
gave no hint of its seriousness. Dick was well satisfied
and returned to his breakfast with a good appetite.</p>

<p>Morris’s absence from school that day went unnoticed.
On Tuesday he appeared, a little gloomy,
but showing no sign of anything wrong save a slight
limp when off his guard. All that week he reported
at practice and no one outside of the field guessed
that he spent the time sitting disconsolately on the
bench, wrapped in a blanket, or in coaching Tupper
and Nelson Beaton at kicking goals! On Friday the
public was admitted to the enclosure, but there was
no scrimmage by the Varsity and the fact that Morris
didn’t even participate in signal work or give an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
exhibition of his booting ability caused no comment,
since it had been understood all the Fall that Morris
was being taken care of and given only enough work
to keep him in condition. On Saturday, when Weston
faced Clearfield, there was no good reason for
kicking field-goals since the Purple found no trouble
in doing pretty much as she pleased with her opponent,
and so again Morris’s absence occasioned no
surprise. He was much in evidence along the side
lines, dressed for play, and if he wasn’t used it was
plainly because Coach Lovering chose to score by
rushing rather than by the aërial route.</p>

<p>Cotner assured himself that no Springdale scouts
had gained admission to the field that day and passed
the news to Dick. Consequently, in the third and
fourth periods, the team tried out some of the new
plays on Weston and saw with much satisfaction that
they puzzled the adversary and gained ground. Although
a light team, Weston was quick to size-up
plays, and that the new ones succeeded against her
argued particularly well for them. Dick put in what
was practically an entirely substitute line-up in the
fourth quarter and the subs gave an excellent account
of themselves. When the final whistle blew the
score was Clearfield 26, Weston 0. There still remained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
much to be accomplished in the remaining
four days of practice before the Springdale contest,
but, on the whole, Dick was satisfied with the work
of his charges. The attack was not yet as smooth
as he wanted it, but on the defense the team had
shown up finely, and against a team which, if not
powerful, was more than ordinarily versatile and resourceful.
Dick’s defense against forward passes
worked well, and Gordon Merrick at left end and
Felker at right covered themselves with glory.
Clearfield’s own attempts at forward passing were
not very successful, but Weston had been coached to
guard against such plays and was consequently hard
to deceive. The Number 8 Play did, however, catch
her napping on two occasions. The school at large
went away highly pleased with the showing of their
team and predicting rout and disaster for Springdale
the following Saturday.</p>

<p>Springdale, too, overwhelmed a weak opponent
that afternoon, as Dick learned by stopping at the
Square on his way home with Gordon in Eli. In
fact, Springdale had scored seven more points than
had Clearfield. But, since it was a question whether
Springdale’s adversary was not an even weaker team
than Weston, Dick refused to be troubled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span></p>

<p>On Sunday Fudge called for his blue-book and
was at first plainly disappointed at Dick’s verdict.
When, however, Dick had explained that what the
team wanted was a play that was deceptive rather
than merely involved Fudge took heart again.
Fudge was a born optimist, anyway, and it took
more than one disappointment to discourage him.</p>

<p>“I g-g-get you now, Dick,” he said, pocketing his
blank-book. “You l-l-leave it to m-m-me! I thought
of a dandy play this morning in church, but I’ve got
to work it out. I’ll show it to you to-morrow. Talk
about deceptiveness! Gee, this is a c-c-corker.”</p>

<p>“That’s fine,” said Dick, with a smile for Fudge’s
confidence. “What’s it like?”</p>

<p>But Fudge refused to divulge any information
regarding it, taking himself off with renewed requests
for Dick to leave it to him! Which Dick,
having lost faith in Fudge’s ability as a football
tactician, was perfectly willing to do.</p>

<p>Tuesday morning the Clearfield paper made a
startling assertion. “In practice yesterday,” it said,
“Morris Brent, High School’s phenomenal goal-kicker,
made what is probably a record hereabouts.
Brent put over seventeen goals from twenty tries,
most of them from difficult angles. If more than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
half of Clearfield’s total against Springdale is not
made by this player’s clever right foot we lose our
guess.”</p>

<p>“Now where in the name of common sense,”
gasped Dick, “did they get that tale?” Lanny, when
Dick repeated the question to him, laughed.</p>

<p>“That’s some of Chester’s nonsense,” he said.
“Billings—he does the High School news for the
paper, you know—met Chester after practice yesterday
and tried to work him for news. Chester told
him he wasn’t allowed to say anything of what went
on at practice. ‘But,’ says Chester, ‘you’re a fellow
who’s seen a lot of football, Billings, and I want to
ask you one thing. Did you ever know of any drop-kicker
putting over seventeen out of twenty, and
from hard angles?’ Of course Billings said he
hadn’t and wanted to know all about it. But Chester
wouldn’t talk, begged Billings not to use what
he had told him, or, if he must use it, not to tell
where he’d got it, and then beat it. So that’s how
that happened.”</p>

<p>Dick smiled and frowned. Finally he laughed.
“Well, that’s what I’d call a near-lie, Lanny. Still,
it <em>is</em> funny! And it won’t do us any harm, either.
I hope the Springdale paper copies it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span></p>

<p>It did, the next morning. It not only copied it
but it enlarged on it and declared that five of the
successful attempts had been made from the forty-yard
line! Chester was vastly amused over the success
of what he termed his diplomacy, but Morris,
oddly enough, was as mad as a hatter about it.</p>

<p>“It makes me look like a fool,” he declared. “Anyone
knows you couldn’t drop five goals over from
the forty in twenty tries! Who started that yarn?”</p>

<p>He wasn’t told, however. As Lanny said, they’d
need Chester’s services next Saturday, and he would
be of far more use whole than in pieces!</p>

<small>CHEERS, SONGS AND SPEECHES</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">That Tuesday afternoon practice was the
hardest of the season. For four twelve-minute
periods, the Scrubs, driven to desperation
by Dick’s reiterated assertion that this was their last
chance to show what they could really do, eternally
prodded by Captain Nostrand and taunted until they
were fighting mad by Quarterback Farrar, drove at
the Varsity as if their future salvation depended on
the utter demolition of the adversary! Nostrand
thumped them on the backs, even kicked them none
too gently when they crouched too high on defense,
shouted threats and pleas until his voice cracked.
Pete Farrar shrilly called them names: “bone-heads,”
“quitters,” “babies,” “pups,” and dared them to show
one tiny scrap of intelligence, of fight! And Dick,
hobbling from one side to the other, scolding, instructing,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
praising sometimes, egged the opponents
on. Even George Cotner, umpiring, took a hand in—or,
rather, lent a voice to—the vocal confusion.</p>

<p>But the Varsity stood firm on defense and was irresistible
on attack, and the Scrubs, yielding grudgingly,
were forced back and back toward their goal
time and again. But how they did fight that day!
One would have thought that the two teams were
the bitterest enemies to have watched them “mix it
up!” Fudge played himself out by the end of the
third period and had to yield to a substitute, as did
others before time was finally called. The Varsity
scored twice in the second quarter, once in the third
and again in the fourth when a fumble gave them the
ball on the opponent’s twelve yards and Lanny in
three tries shot across for another six points. Twice
the Scrub got to the Varsity’s five-yard line and
twice she failed to score. Field-goals were barred
to both teams and it was rush, pass or nothing, and
the Scrubs piled themselves up against a defense
that was like a concrete foundation. Later, just
before the game ended, the Varsity, by two well-managed
forward passes, took the pigskin to the
Scrub’s twelve yards. Less than a minute of time
remained and, after an ineffectual attack at right<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
guard by Nelson Beaton, Hull, who had taken Chester
Cottrell’s place, called “39—69—408!” He
jumped a step to the right. Beaton went back to
kicking distance. Again the signal “39—69—408——”</p>

<p>Back sped the ball to the fullback. The lines
heaved and swayed. Off dodged the ends, right and
left. Beaton trotted to the right, poised the ball.
Right half hurled himself against an obtrusive
tackle, recovered and sped toward the side line.
Then the line broke, the Scrubs came piling through,
leaping, panting, arms upstretched. Hull went down
under the onset. But Beaton, his gaze on an upthrust
hand near the goal line, dodged a Scrub forward
and hurled the ball straight and true above the
mêlée. Too late the Scrub backs saw the trick. The
pigskin flew into right end’s arms and that youth
romped across the last white mark and sank to his
knees between the posts! Number 8 had worked
once more!</p>

<p>Dick led Fudge aside later in the dressing-room.
“I got that play, Fudge,” he said. “Sorry I wasn’t
in when you came.”</p>

<p>“What do you think of it?” demanded Fudge exultantly.
“Isn’t it a peach, Dick?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span></p>

<p>Dick smiled. “I think so,” he replied. “I’ll try
it out to-morrow. It isn’t a play that we could use
more than once in a game, Fudge, for its merit lies
in its power to surprise the other chap, and he
wouldn’t fall for it more than once, I guess.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why,” Fudge objected.</p>

<p>“Think a minute,” answered Dick gently. “The
quarter kneels to hold the ball and then runs with it.
The opponent might think once that it was a bona-fide
placement-kick, Fudge, but the next time he
would be on the lookout. And instead of getting
sucked in he’d watch the quarter and his backs would
go through outside of tackle and smear the pass.
But never mind that. It looks promising for a one-time
play and, I believe, it’s going to be just what
we will want on Saturday. I only wish you’d
thought of it before, Fudge.”</p>

<p>“So do I. But, say, I’ve got another one——”</p>

<p>“Save it for next season,” laughed Dick. “There’s
no time to teach more plays now. What’s the matter
with your ear?”</p>

<p>“Some idiot kicked it, I guess.” Fudge felt of it
cautiously and winced.</p>

<p>“Better bathe it. It’s pretty well swollen. Well,
thanks for the play, Fudge.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span></p>

<p>There was a mass-meeting in assembly hall that
evening and the fellows sang and cheered enthusiastically
until, at nine, Lanny and Dick appeared
and mounted the platform. Lanny spoke first. He
had a simple, direct way of talking that pleased his
hearers, and to-night, although he said nothing very
new, he managed to work the meeting into a fine
frenzy. Cheers followed, repeated over and over,
and then Dick arose and faced a new tumult. He
couldn’t help but contrast this greeting with that
which had met him at that former meeting, and the
thought brought a smile to his face. When the
cheers had subsided he spoke:</p>

<p>“Fellows, there isn’t much anyone can say on the
eve of a big game; and, anyhow, Captain White
has got ahead of me. I do want to thank you personally,
though, just as White thanked you on behalf
of the team, for the splendid support you have given
us all season.” A few chuckles were heard. “I want
to thank you too for your—for the good feeling
you’ve shown me. I appreciate it. And I want to
tell you that it has made a difference; helped more
than you can possibly realize. I don’t want to seem
to be asking for credit for whatever share I’ve had
in the development of the team, but I do want to say<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
to you that when I undertook this job I didn’t appreciate
what it meant. It’s been—well, it’s been hard
work, fellows; harder work than I expected. And
there have been lots of discouraging moments. And
that’s why I say that you’ve helped me, just as you’ve
helped us all, by letting me know, as you have let
me know, that you had confidence in me in spite of
my—my limitations.”</p>

<p>“Now, fellows, your part—your share in this isn’t
done yet. It won’t be done until the final horn
squawks Saturday afternoon. You can do a lot
from now on, quite as much as you’ve done already.
I want you not only to believe thoroughly that we’re
going to win, but I want you to make the team understand
that you believe it, and I want you—I ask
you particularly to make Springdale know that you
believe it. There’s a lot of talk nowadays about psychology—whatever
that is—and some of it’s probably
poppycock. But I firmly believe that there’s
such a thing as so impressing the adversary with
your confidence that he will be affected by it. It
isn’t just a theory, either; I’ve seen it work out more
than once!”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’d like me to tell you what I really
think about our chances to win on Saturday. Well,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
I’m going to tell you even at the risk of making the
team overconfident, which is something it can’t afford
to be. I think we’re going to win, and win decisively!”
Dick had to wait for the applause to subside
then. “I don’t mean by that that we’ll pile up
a big score, for I think the teams will be too evenly
matched to score many times. But I do mean that
when the battle is over there won’t be any doubt as
to which is the better team. I’m not belittling the
enemy. Springdale has a fine team, a team at least
twenty-five per cent better than she had last year.
You have only to study the results of the games she
has played this season to realize that. But, on the
other hand, we’ve got a fine team, too. Along——”</p>

<p>More cheering then, wild and continued.</p>

<p>“Along in the middle of the season I told you that
our team was no more than an averagely good one,
I think. It wasn’t—then. Now it is. It’s as good
a team as ever represented the School, and that’s
saying not a little when you recall some of the teams,
which, although not very lately, have defeated
Springdale by overwhelming scores. But good as it
is, it’s got to play hard, play for all it’s worth, play
like—like thunder! The Springdale line is a strong
one. Few teams have made much impression on it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
this Fall. The Springdale backs are a fast and clever
lot and have scoring power. The team has been
finely coached and knows a lot of football. They
have good punters over there, too; no better than
ours, I think, but not to be despised. There’s one
thing they haven’t got, fellows, and that’s a man to
kick field-goals!”</p>

<p>Cheers and shouts of “Brent! Brent! A-ay,
Brent!” broke into the discourse, and Morris, sitting
in the front row, studied his scarred hands attentively
and hid the look in his eyes.</p>

<p>“I want to prophesy, fellows,” continued Dick,
“that if we get the ball inside the Springdale fifteen-yard
line we’ll score!”</p>

<p>“I’m not saying how we’ll score,” he added with a
smile when he could go on, “but we’ll score!”</p>

<p>Cheers and laughter mingled, and some one increased
the latter by shouting: “Every little three-spot
counts, old man!”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s all I have to say,” ended Dick.
“You’ve got the team. All you’ve got to do is to be
back of it every minute and let the other fellow see
that you’re back of it. Don’t get the glooms if they
score first. Keep on cheering. The game isn’t over
till it’s won!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span></p>

<p>The meeting gave itself over to riot for several
minutes. Then the singing began again and finally,
hoarse, jubilant, excited, the fellows made their way
out of the hall and down the stairs to form in a procession
outside the building and march cheering and
singing through the quiet streets of Clearfield, acquainting
the sleepy inhabitants with the fact that
the team was “all right,” that Captain White was
“all right,” that Coach Lovering was equally “all
right” and that “So play as you may you can’t play
better than he with a C. H. S. on his sweater!”</p>

<p>On Thursday there was no scrimmage, but instead
a hard two hours of drill. Fudge’s play was tried,
but, since all proceedings were behind closed gates,
we are not presumed to know how that child of his
fertile brain turned out. Still, merely judging by
Fudge’s pleased and important expression during the
next day or two, it is allowable to suppose that the
play proved satisfactory. On Friday the school
marched in a body to the field with banners flying
and purple megaphones beating time to the strains
of “Clearfield’s Day” performed by Dahl’s Silver
Cornet Band—eleven strong—and sung by some
hundred and fifty voices. There was no scrimmage,
but the two Varsity squads trotted up and down in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
signal work and kicked a few goals—or tried to—(for
some reason Morris Brent wasn’t given an
opportunity to prove his ability)—and the spectators
stood up in the stand and cheered and sang at the
behest of a boy with a yard-long megaphone and enthusiasm
was rampant!</p>

<p>And at the end of twenty minutes or so the Scrub
Team, who had finally doffed their uniforms the day
before, gathered together in front of the stand and
cheered the Varsity, and the Varsity squads joined
forces nearby and heartily cheered the Scrubs, and
all preliminaries were at last over and the stage was
set for the performance!</p>

<small>CABLE KICKS OFF</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">There was a final gathering of the council
at Dick’s that evening, what time the School
was conducting its last football mass-meeting
in assembly hall. Lanny, Cottrell, Cotner and
Tupper attended; and Dick, of course. Tupper
had been asked to come since Dick wanted to
go over carefully the plays that were to be used
in the morrow’s game, and it had been decided that
in case Lanny was forced to leave the team George
Tupper should act as captain. They were all rather
serious to-night. Lanny especially, showed the
strain. Dick felt it but did not show it. Of the
five, Chester Cottrell alone seemed fairly in his
usual condition of mind.</p>

<p>Together they went through the game from start
to finish, providing as well as they might for every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
contingency. Plays were prescribed for this situation
and that, and Chester was put through an examination
in the choice of them that would have staggered
a less confident youth. One or two doubtful
plays which had been placed in the repertory were
now stricken out, for somehow this evening their
judgment seemed to have found a new clarity.</p>

<p>“Sometimes I think we’ve got too many plays,”
observed Dick doubtfully. “But we don’t have to
use them I suppose.”</p>

<p>“The only objection to having a lot is that the
fellows are liable to get them mixed,” said Lanny.
“Still, if we drop 3 and 11 that leaves us only eight
‘freaks.’”</p>

<p>“I don’t like that word ‘freak,’” said Dick, with
a smile. “I hope they won’t prove ‘freaks!’”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry, Dick,” replied Chester heartily.
“The plays we’ve got are all right. And you’ll
find that they’ll keep Springdale guessing, too. The
only one I’m scared of is that Number 10, the one
Fudge calls his ‘secret play.’”</p>

<p>“How the dickens did he happen to think that
up?” asked Tupper.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how he thought of it,” replied
Chester, “but I don’t believe it will work, fellows.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span></p>

<p>“It isn’t expected to work more than once,” answered
Dick, “and then, as you understand, Chester,
only under certain conditions that may not happen.
I’ve mulled it over a lot, and I realize that it’s risky,
but if we pull it off—or try to—we’ll be where it’s
going to be necessary to take a risk. And, after
all, fellows, more games are lost by avoiding risks
than by taking them.”</p>

<p>“If it comes to that,” said Lanny, “we won’t
have anything to lose by that play if it goes wrong.
It’s to be used on third down, you know.”</p>

<p>“Sure, but wouldn’t another play be more certain?”
asked Chester.</p>

<p>“A forward pass?” inquired Lanny.</p>

<p>“Not necessarily. That direct pass to fullback
for an end run, for instance. That’s a hard play to
size-up because it’s hidden until the runner gets
started. I like that play and I think it’s going to
work any number of times. But this ‘Secret Play,’
as you call it——”</p>

<p>“I don’t call it that; I call it Number 10,” remonstrated
Dick.</p>

<p>“Well, whatever you call it, I don’t see what’s to
keep Springdale from tearing through on it and
smothering it ’way behind our line.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span></p>

<p>“Well, you saw how it went yesterday,” said
Lanny.</p>

<p>“I didn’t see it tried out before an opponent,”
answered Chester dryly. There was silence for a
moment. Then:</p>

<p>“Well, if you fellows think it isn’t going to make
good, cut it,” said Dick. “I may be all wrong about
it. And, as Chester says, we didn’t have a chance
to try it in a scrimmage.”</p>

<p>“Mind you,” said Chester, “I haven’t got cold feet
on it. That is, I’ll try it, all right, and make it go
if it can be done. Only thing I say is that I
don’t see how it’s going to fool the other fellow!”</p>

<p>“As Dick says,” observed Lanny, “it’s a risk, but
we’ve got to take risks to-morrow. I say use it.”</p>

<p>“All right. That’s good enough for me,” agreed
Chester cheerfully. “If it does go, it’ll go hard;
I’ll say that for it!”</p>

<p>After the others had gone, bidding him good night
rather soberly on the porch, Dick took himself to
bed. But sleep didn’t come readily to-night. There
was too much to think of. He wondered over and
over if he had done wisely here or well there,
wondered for the hundredth time if his plans, his
methods, his strategies were to be crowned with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
success. He wondered whether the team was really
as good as it had seemed to him yesterday, even this
afternoon. There were moments, as, tossing back
and forth on his pillow, he heard eleven and twelve
o’clock strike, when it seemed to him that nothing
but certain defeat impended, that there was not the
smallest chance in the world for a Clearfield victory!
That wasn’t a pleasant vigil that Dick kept up there
under the roof that night.</p>

<p>Some time after twelve he fell asleep, but only
to turn and mutter for a long while after as his
tired mind evolved dream after dream in all of
which misfortune pursued him relentlessly.</p>

<p>When he awoke the world was gray and cold,
with a foretaste of snow in the air, and he found
nothing in the outlook to inspirit him. But a cold
bath set sluggish blood to tingling again and a cup of
steaming-hot coffee brought back courage and determination.
While he was looking through the
papers the telephone bell rang and he found Manager
Cotner on the line, irritated of voice. Springdale
had just telephoned over for thirty-five more seats
and they didn’t have that many unless they could
get the workmen out there to put up some temporary
ones. The matter was really outside<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
Dick’s jurisdiction, but George was so perplexed
that Dick gave his mind to the problem for a
moment.</p>

<p>“There wouldn’t be time before two-fifteen to
get seats up, George,” he answered after an instant’s
reflection. “Call up Mr. Grayson and see if he will
let you have half a dozen rows of chairs from
assembly hall. I think he will if you tell him your
fix. You can put them along the front of the
Springdale section.”</p>

<p>That was but the beginning of the telephone’s
activity. Chester called up next, and after him
George Cotner again. George was now in a condition
of sputtering wrath. The Springdale manager
had just telephoned that Wonson, the man who was
to have umpired the game, couldn’t officiate, owing
to illness, and could Clearfield find some one to take
his place. Springdale would be satisfied with anyone
selected.</p>

<p>“Get right after Mr. Cochran, George. Try the
Y.M.C.A. first. If he’s not there run around to his
house on D Street; the white house near the corner
of Lafayette. I think he will do it. How about
the seats?”</p>

<p>“They’re all right. I’m trying to get hold of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
Stuart now. Sorry to bother you so much, Dick.
Good-by.”</p>

<p>After that until late afternoon Dick had no chance
to be gloomy. He was much too busy.</p>

<p>The team and substitutes gathered at twelve
o’clock at the Mansion, the smaller and quieter of
Clearfield’s two hotels, and had their luncheon.
Dick presided and did his best to keep the fellows
steady. On the whole there was little indication of
nervousness and the meal passed off quite cheerily.
At one they adjourned to the upstairs parlor, where,
behind closed doors, Dick put them through a final
examination in signals. By that time the town
showed the presence of the invader. Blue banners
and arm-bands and megaphones were in evidence on
the streets and the cars coming up Pine Street from
the station were well filled. Manager Cotner joined
the team, breathless and tired, just before they were
ready to start for the field.</p>

<p>“I’ve just had an awful experience,” he gasped as
he sank into a chair. “Mr. Grayson telephoned to
me for an extra pair of tickets and <em>wanted to pay
for them</em>! What are we coming to?”</p>

<p>“Did you let him?” laughed Bert Cable.</p>

<p>“No, but the experience quite unnerved me. Cochran’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
going to umpire for us, fellows. The Springdale
chap’s got tonsilitis or laryngitis or bronchitis
or—or——”</p>

<p>“Coldfeetitis,” suggested Lanny. “Cochran’s all
right, I guess. What’s the time, Dick?”</p>

<p>“Time to go. Are the cars pretty full, George?”</p>

<p>“Jammed! Looks as if all Springdale was here.
They’re running extras through from the station,
though, and I guess we can crowd on. All ready?
Come on, then. Gee, but I wish this was over!”</p>

<p>By a quarter past two, when Springdale came on
for practice, the stands were nearly filled. The Blue
had a section to herself and it was ablossom with
waving flags and small white-lettered megaphones.
Dahl’s Silver Cornet Band, augmented for the occasion
to the grand total of fourteen pieces, discoursed
sweet—well, discoursed music; let us not be
too particular as to the quality of it. Springdale
was well represented, Clearfield was there in force.
Dick had given tickets to Louise Brent and Mrs.
Brent as well as to his sister and mother, and they
were seated together in the front of the stand,
Louise armed with a silken purple flag.</p>

<p>Five minutes after the Blue team appeared Clearfield’s
warriors emerged from the dressing-room<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
and, Lanny leading, trotted out to warm up.
Mr. Newman, the Blue’s coach, crossed the gridiron
and shook hands with Dick, and the two talked for
a minute. Then Mr. Cochran appeared, and, presently
the referee, Mr. Lothrop, joined the group.
At each end of the field balls were arching over and
under the cross-bars, Nelson Beaton and George
Tupper trying their kicking feet for Clearfield and
Sawtell and Norton for Springdale. Morris Brent,
although he had trotted about for a minute with
the first squad, had returned to the bench. At two
minutes before the half-hour the teams returned to
the side lines and Mr. Lothrop walked into the center
of the gridiron with Lanny, while from across the
field came Captain Torrey, of Springdale. The two
leaders shook hands with each other and Torrey with
the referee. Then a silver coin gleamed for a moment
in the sunlight which since noon had been shining
half-heartedly through the sullen clouds, three
heads bent over it as it fell, Torrey’s hand waved
toward the east goal and the little group broke up.</p>

<p>“All right, fellows!” called Lanny cheerfully as
he came back to the bench. “We kick off from the
west goal. On the run now!”</p>

<p>Blankets and sweaters were dropped and eleven<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
purple-stockinged youths raced out to spread themselves
across the field. Springdale arranged herself
for the kick. A last cheer came from the stand and
silence fell.</p>

<p>“All ready, Captain Torrey?” called the referee.
“All ready, Captain White?”</p>

<p>The whistle sounded. Bert Cable, who had teed
the ball to his liking, stepped forward and swung
his foot and the game was on.</p>

<p class="p2 cap">That was the way the teams lined up at the
start, with no surprises on either side, unless,
possibly, the absence of Brent at fullback
could be considered such. But it had been Clearfield’s
policy all the Fall to put Brent in only when a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
field-goal was called for, and the fact that he did not
start the game aroused no suspicion. Morris,
blanket-wrapped, sat beside Dick on the Clearfield
bench and watched moodily as Sawtell caught the
kick-off some dozen yards in front of his goal and
sprang forward with the ball. Merrick tried for him
and missed and it was Wayland who finally locked
his arms about the runner and downed him on the
twenty-yard line.</p>

<p>Clearfield applauded the tackle and the teams
faced each other. Springdale used a formation in
which the ends dropped back a little and the backs
made an oblique tandem behind right or left guard.
A shift which placed a guard or both guard and
tackle on the opposite side of the line was generally
used, and sometimes the backs formed behind the
long side and sometimes behind the short side, a
feature which caused not a little perplexity to Clearfield
during the first of the game. A split attack,
the first man in the tandem going to the right, the
second man straight ahead, followed by the quarter
carrying the ball, and the third man to the left, was
a favorite play and fooled the opponent many times.
Springdale stuck to attacks between tackles all during
the first period, punting when unable to gain by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
rushing. Her line was heavy and fast, played low
and hard and usually managed to open holes. The
backs started from close behind and struck the line
almost as soon as the ball was put in play. Springdale’s
policy was to “get the jump” on her adversary,
and it must be acknowledged that she succeeded.
The oblique tandem leaped into place just before the
ball was snapped and often the play came through
while Clearfield was still moving to meet it.</p>

<p>From the twenty-yards to the forty Springdale
worked her way without pause, the backs making
short but consistent gains between Partridge and
Wayland and finding the right side of the Clearfield
line the easier proposition. Arthur Beaton was put
out of the play time and again, and Dick sent Kent
in for him at the end of some five or six minutes.
Springdale’s supporters were cheering incessantly as
the Blue plowed her way toward the middle of the
field. Kent bore a message to Cottrell, and Clearfield,
who had been playing six men in the line, now
dropped her other end back. This allowed both halfbacks
to close in toward the middle and the next two
tries at the center failed.</p>

<p>Still disdaining end runs, Springdale sent Norton
back to kicking position and “knifed” her left half<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
between guard and tackle on the left. But the fake
had not deceived the adversary and Cook was stopped
for a slight gain by Tupper. Springdale then punted
from the forty-eight yards and the ball went out at
Clearfield’s twenty-three. It was the Purple’s chance
to applaud and a hearty cheer went up as the ball was
brought in and the teams lined up again. Formation
B evidently inspired the opponent with misgiving,
for she dropped her backs into a deep basket
formation, leaving five men in the line and spreading
them well open. Cottrell tried out the other team’s
defense with a straight plunge at center which went
through nicely and followed it by a run off tackle
on the left that added three yards. With two to go,
Lanny piled through right guard for first down.
Springdale brought her backs further in, being convinced
that Clearfield’s strange arrangement of her
backfield did not necessarily foretell a forward pass,
and two tries at the left netted the Purple but four
yards. Faking a plunge at the center, Cottrell sent
Tupper tearing off to the right, but the interference
failed and he was stopped near the side line for no
gain. Lanny punted to Springdale’s forty and
Felker downed the catcher in his tracks.</p>

<p>Springdale, her quarter running off his plays like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
lightning, came steadily back. Kent was proving
hardly stronger than Arthur Beaton, and many plays
went through his position to be stopped by the secondary
defense. Lanny played a magnificent defensive
game, sensing the point of attack and jumping to
meet it. More than once he was literally awaiting
the runner when the latter shot through. Springdale
was showing a powerful offense and her linemen
were playing like veterans, which, with three
exceptions they were not. Back past the center of
the field the Blue progressed, using old-fashioned
football all the time but using it so well that the
brunt of the defense was falling to the lot of the
Clearfield backs. Springdale got her plays off so
quickly and from so close to the line that it was
difficult for Clearfield to foretell the point of attack.
A penalty for holding set her back but failed to stop
her. On Clearfield’s forty-two, with four to go on
third down, Kelly, the Blue’s quarter, again tried
a fake-kick, and this time Clearfield failed to size-up
the play. Kelly himself plunged through Cable and
eluded Lanny for twelve yards and the Blue flags
waved riotously in the stand.</p>

<p>The pigskin was now almost on Clearfield’s thirty.
The Blue’s fullback hit the line for three yards, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
tried again for no gain. A split attack went past
Haley for three more and, on the twenty-five-yard
line, Kelly again sent Norton back. This time the
play was a double pass, and Sawtell got through
between Kent and Wayland, the defense having
been badly fooled. The tape was used and first
down was declared. Before the ball could be put in
play again the quarter ended.</p>

<p>The teams traversed the field and lined up again
on the twenty yards. Clearfield now played her ends
in and spread her backs. Kelly failed to gain at the
right and Sawtell made three through the opposite
side. Clearfield’s supporters were imploring the
Purple to hold. Springdale sent Norton back and
rushed two backs and an end to the left as the ball
was snapped. Norton swung his leg, side-stepped
and hurled across to the group. But the throw was
short and Felker knocked it down. Again Norton
went back, but the ball was passed to Cook and that
youth went dodging and spinning through the center.
But he was stopped on the fifteen yards and
the ball went to the defenders.</p>

<p>Two plunges gained four yards and Lanny kicked
from almost under the goal. The ball went low
and rolled erratically, finally being dropped on by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
Kelly close to the tee in midfield. Springdale accepted
the challenge and punted on second down
after a two-yard gain. Cottrell caught on his twenty-four
yards and dodged back seven before he was
thrown. From kick formation Lanny took the ball
around Springdale’s right end for five yards. A
forward pass was then attempted, Cottrell to Merrick,
but Springdale had guessed the play and Merrick
failed to make the catch. Lanny punted to the
Blue’s twenty-seven and Cook brought it back five.
Springdale now started at the ends and her first attempt
sent Sawtell around Merrick for twelve. A
fumble was recovered with a loss of four yards.
Norton tried Cable but was thrown back and Cook
failed to get through Wayland. Norton punted to
the Purple’s twenty-six and Lanny fumbled but recovered
on the twenty-yard line.</p>

<p>Dick sent Hansard in for Tupper who was limping
badly. Hansard bore instructions to Cottrell to
get his plays off faster and an improvement in the
speed of the team at once resulted. The teams were
well over on the left of the gridiron and Cottrell
pulled off the Number 6 play with success. This
play brought Merrick running obliquely back from
position before the ball went into play, Hansard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
going into the line between guard and tackle on the
other side to maintain the required number there.
Beaton played back in kicking position. The ball
went to Cottrell, however, and he made a two-handed
pass to Merrick as the latter swung by between
him and Beaton and, with Lanny interfering,
raced in a wide arc around his own right wing.
Springdale was caught napping and Gordon covered
eighteen yards before he was stopped. Enthusiasm
took possession of the Clearfield supporters and purple
megaphones howled and shrieked.</p>

<p>Springdale was for the moment off her balance,
it seemed, for a skin-tackle play on the left, with
Lanny hugging the pigskin, went for seven yards.
Cottrell speeded up the team and in two plays the
ball passed the middle of the field. With three to go
on third down, Hansard, keeping his feet wonderfully,
fought straight through for six. Springdale
tightened then and Lanny was thrown for no gain
when he tried the left of the opponent’s line. Beaton
fell back to kicking position and hurled the ball
across the line to Felker. The latter got it but fumbled
when tackled and the ball popped into the arms
of a Springdale back, who was downed on his thirty-four.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span></p>

<p>The rest of the period was Springdale’s, for she
came back hard and for a time almost drove Clearfield
off her feet. Wayland was hurt and gave way
to Scott and Springdale replaced her right guard
and her left tackle. But there was not time to score
by the methods Springdale used. Only twice were
runs outside of tackle resorted to, the Blue apparently
striving to wear down the Purple’s defense by
furious assaults. Once Cook nearly got away, but
was pulled down from behind by Lanny after he had
made almost fifteen yards through the right of the
Clearfield line. On the Purple’s twenty-eight
Springdale made a forward pass to the side of the
field, and again, for a breath-taking moment, it
seemed that the Blue was about to score. But Cottrell
forced the runner over the line at the twenty
yards and before Springdale could gain farther the
whistle blew, bringing the half to an end.</p>

<p>The Clearfield players trotted to the dressing-room
and the visitors retired to a tent in a corner
of the field. Cheers and songs started again, the
band played its loudest and some twelve hundred
spectators excitedly discussed what had happened
and predicted what was going to happen. There
was no gainsaying the fact that the Blue had shown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
the more consistent offense or that in the matter of
punting she had fully equaled the home team. That
Clearfield plainly possessed a more versatile attack
was allowed, but whether she had plays capable of
gaining inside the twenty-yard line was a question,
except that, as everyone knew, Brent could be depended
on to score from the field provided the line
held. Doubtless Clearfield would do her utmost in
the next half to reach a position where Brent’s science
could be used. As to defense, it seemed a toss-up
between the Purple and the Blue. Both teams
had been well trained in that department. If there
was any difference it lay in the fact that Springdale’s
forwards were a bit quicker at charging, thus
leaving less work to the backs. In the two periods
played Springdale had made eight first downs to
Clearfield’s three, not an encouraging showing for
the home team.</p>

<p>Perhaps Dick was considering that as he followed
the team and substitutes into the dressing-room. At
least, he looked sober enough in all truth. Springdale
was not showing the signs of overtraining that
Dick had more or less counted on, although there
had been moments in the last few minutes of the
second period when he had thought he could detect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
a falling off in the power of the attack. The removal
of two linemen also suggested that the Blue
was approaching its limit of endurance. For his
own team Dick had no fears. They had stood the
hard smashing of the Springdale backs excellently.
Not a player had weakened under the strain and
none of those taken out had sustained injuries sufficient
to prevent his reinstatement. Dick expected
the Purple to play better in the next two periods,
expected it, in fact, to finish stronger than it had
begun, for there was no denying that it had played
a slower and more listless game than it had showed
against Weston the week before.</p>

<p>While the fellows were being rubbed and having
their bruises attended to, Dick conferred with Lanny
and Chester Cottrell. Lanny was pretty well keyed-up,
Chester unusually grim and silent.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to have Tupper back, Dick,” declared
the captain. “Hansard doesn’t get into it.”</p>

<p>“All right, Lanny. And look here, you’ve got to
hump that line up on defense. Do you get me?
They’re getting the jump on us every time. What’s
the trouble?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Lanny rather wildly.
“They’ve been letting every blessed play through on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
us. That’s a mean attack of theirs, Dick; you
can’t size it up.”</p>

<p>“I know, but you’ve got to watch the ball, Lanny.
You can’t tell where the play’s coming by guessing.
Another thing, fellows. It won’t do to spread your
backs too much near goal. Better play your ends
well out and force the runner in, and keep your backs
behind center. They haven’t any running game that
we need fear, I think. Of course they’ll try to
spring something this half, and we’ll have to be on
the watch for it, but, whatever you do, Lanny, and
you, Chester, don’t let them score on a line play!
They can’t if you charge quick and watch the ball.
And, Chester, you’re not getting your plays off fast
enough. I want to see things go twice as fast this
half. It’s their kick-off this time. Let’s see if we
can’t take that ball straight down the field, fellows.
I’ll tell you frankly that you haven’t been putting up
half the game you did against Weston or Lesterville.
You’ve got to wake up and fight, that’s what you’ve
got to do. I’m well enough satisfied with what’s
happened so far. We’ve let them work themselves
pretty tired, I guess, and we’ve held them off. But
for the rest of the game we’ve got to jump and
smear them. We’ve got to force the fighting, fellows.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
Line up quickly, get your signals off quickly
and then—” Dick smote a fist into the other hand—“smash
into ’em!”</p>

<p>The others nodded, Lanny eagerly, Chester
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“And use your delayed plays more, Chester. Try
that Number 8, and if it goes keep on using it. And
once near their goal hammer the left side of their
line. That new tackle of theirs doesn’t look much
to me. Stick Beaton through there a few times.
Find the weak spot and hammer it flat! But, above
all, play fast! You’ve got to do it!”</p>

<p>Dick turned on his heel and sought Tupper.
“How’s that knee, George?” he asked.</p>

<p>“All right, Dick!” To prove it, Tupper arose
eagerly from the bench and swung his leg. Dick
smiled.</p>

<p>“All right. Go in again. But take care of it.
And, George, we’ve got to play faster than we’ve
been playing. See if you can’t get more jump into
it. Merrick and Felker, here, please!”</p>

<p>For several minutes Dick spoke earnestly and in
low tones to the two ends. Then Manager Cotner,
who had been keeping track of the time, announced
that only four minutes remained, and Dick swung<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
himself over to the window and faced the room.
The noise died away.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to tell you fellows that you’ve
played good football, because you haven’t,” began
Dick earnestly. “You’ve let Springdale get the
jump on you all through the half. You haven’t
watched the ball as you should and you’ve been
fooled time after time for that reason alone. You’re
every bit as good as Springdale, but you don’t let
them know it. You linemen have let play after play
go through you just because you’ve been watching
your opponents instead of the ball. You’ll never
win that way, fellows. You’re putting too much
work on the backs. They can’t do it all. You’ve
got to keep your eyes on the ball and charge quick
and hard. Some of you have been playing much
too high. Get down low, and when you charge lift
them up. Remember that you’re facing men several
pounds heavier than you are. The only way to even
that up is to play faster than they do. Don’t meet
them on your side of the line; meet them on theirs!”</p>

<p>“The same thing is true of you backs. You’ve
started slow almost every time. And you’ve let up
when you hit the line. Don’t do it! Get your speed
before you strike the line and then keep on going!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
I ought not to have to tell you these things at this
late day. You know them well enough, but you
don’t do them. Or you <em>haven’t</em> done them. You’ve
got to for the rest of the game, though, if you want
to win. Some one’s going to score this half. It
might as well be us. But if it is to be us we’ve got
to play better football. We’ve got to watch the ball,
play like lightning and fight like bear-cats! Springdale
is going to tire before long, but she’s got a lot
of fight in her yet, and you’ve got to work hard to
keep her from winning. I want you fellows to go
back there now and start in and everlastingly play
football! Wake up and show something! You’ve
got it, fellows, so show it! When you get the ball
at the kick-off, hang on to it and take it right down
the field and put it over! You can do it if you’ll
only think so. That’s all. Play hard, Clearfield, and
fast—<em>fast</em>—FAST! Now then: Merrick, Partridge,
Cable, Haley, A. Beaton, Scott, Felker, Cottrell,
White, Tupper and N. Beaton. All right!”</p>

<p>“On the run, fellows!” cried Lanny.</p>

<p>The door slammed open and out they trailed, the
team to throw off their blankets and race into the
field and the substitutes to huddle again along the
bench and watch and wait. Cheers met them and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
the band started “See, the Conquering Hero
Comes,” much out of tune, perhaps, but enthusiastically
enough to make up for lack of harmony.
Clearfield spread itself about the east end of the field
and Springdale lined up behind its forty yards while
Heath, the center, built up the tee and cocked the
ball to his liking. The sun had gone behind the
clouds again and a little cold breeze was quartering
the field from the northwest, causing spectators to
pull rugs around their knees and button coats at the
necks and the players to trot about as they waited
for the whistle.</p>

<p>“Ready, Captain Torrey?”</p>

<p>“Ready, sir!”</p>

<p>“Ready, Captain White?”</p>

<p>“All ready, sir!”</p>

<p>The whistle blew, Heath strode forward and
swung a long leg and the pigskin arched into air
again.</p>

<small>THE SECRET PLAY</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Tupper caught near the side of the field and
allowed himself to be forced over at the
twenty-yard line. The ball was taken in and
Chester Cottrell slapped his hands and barked out
his signal:</p>

<p>“White back! 47—68—62!”</p>

<p>Lanny fell back to kicking position, Nelson Beaton
taking his place behind left guard, and Chester
jumped aside to the right.</p>

<p>“47—68—62!”</p>

<p>Back shot the ball to Chester, off darted Tupper
for the guard-tackle hole on the right. Beaton and
Lanny swung wide to the left. For a moment the
lines heaved and fought. Then, the ball clutched
to his stomach, Chester plunged straight ahead and
went through where Haley and Arthur Beaton had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span>
opened a wide hole. The Springdale line had been
pulled apart and the secondary defense had been
drawn out. Chester slipped away from a tackle
and staggered on, dodged past a back and was
pulled down finally after ten yards had passed
under his feet. The linesmen pulled up their rods
and scampered past two white marks and the
Clearfield section shouted wildly. Chester, breathless,
was pulled to his feet and trotted back to
position.</p>

<p>“Regular formation!” he called. “Line up! Get
down there, Scott! Signals! 309—25—62!” Lanny
jumped to the right in front of Chester. “309—25—62!”</p>

<p>It was Lanny’s ball, direct from center, and he
sprang at the same hole as before, Tupper clearing
it out for him. But only two yards resulted this
time. “Second down! Eight to go!” announced
the referee.</p>

<p>“Line up quickly!” called Chester. “Here we go
now! Regular formation! Signals! 98—99—84!
98—99—!”</p>

<p>The ball went to Chester, was passed to Nelson
Beaton, and that youth struck like a cannon ball at
the opposing left guard and tackle hole and piled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
through for four yards. Clearfield was “getting the
jump” on her opponent at last!</p>

<p>“Get up! Get up!” shrieked Chester impatiently.
“Signals!”</p>

<p>The ball was on Springdale’s thirty-six yards now,
it was third down and four to go. Lanny pulled
Chester’s head down and whispered. “Signals!”
repeated the latter. “22—53—306! 22—53—!”</p>

<p>Tupper had slipped into the line between right
guard and tackle and now Gordon Merrick was
running back toward where Nelson Beaton crouched
behind Chester. Then came the ball to the latter.
Off raced Lanny behind his line toward the right.
Chester passed to Gordon and that player, one hand
outstretched to ward off attack and the ball in the
crook of his right elbow, followed Lanny. The
Springdale tackle was boxed and Felker sent a
halfback flying out of the path. Then the cry of
“<em>In! In!</em>” was heard and Gordon, passing behind
his interference, sped through an opening in the
enemy’s front and was laid low for a seven-yard
gain.</p>

<p>The middle of the field was in sight now and thus
far every play had told. A plunge at the Clearfield
right, Beaton carrying the ball, gained three, Lanny<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
shot outside of left end for four more, Beaton
made two at center and Chester knifed himself
through for first down on Springdale’s forty-six
yards. The Clearfield supporters were cheering incessantly
and the bass drum was <em>thump—thumping</em>
loudly. Springdale was fighting desperately, but
the pace was beginning to tell on her.</p>

<p>Time was called for an injury to a Springdale
tackle, and when, finally, he was on his feet again,
an eager-faced youth was reporting to the referee.
“Holman, sir! Left tackle!” The injured player
yielded his head-guard and limped off and the new
arrival gathered the team about him and for a moment
or two there was a whispered conference, interrupted
by the referee. Then the panting players
faced each other again, the backs crouched behind
Cottrell and he piped his signals.</p>

<p>Beaton slammed into the line at left guard and
got through for nearly three yards, but Scott had
been detected off-side and Clearfield was set back
five yards. With fifteen to gain, Lanny tried his
own left end, but failed to get past. Beaton hit the
center for two on a delayed pass. Lanny got three
through left guard. Beaton went back to kicking
position and Partridge crossed to the right of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
line. Cottrell and Tupper moved to protect the
punter. Then the ball was snapped to Beaton, who
swung his foot, ran half a dozen paces to the right
and poised the ball. Cottrell and Tupper guarded
his front for a moment and then the latter swung
wide to the right toward the side line and Lanny
cut through outside tackle and went down the field.
Merrick and Felker had also sought positions for the
pass, but Felker was guarded. Beaton waited until
the last moment and then, just as the Springdale
players leaped upon him stepped back a pace and
hurled to Lanny who was for the moment unguarded.
The throw went over the center of the line,
just escaped the upstretched hands of the leaping
Blues, and was caught by Lanny nearly twenty
yards away. Like a flash he wheeled and set off
down the field. But the Springdale quarter was
not to be denied and Lanny was pulled down on
the Blue’s twenty-six yards.</p>

<p>Cheers and shrieks of delight came from the
stand. Dick nodded to Morris and that youth arose
and walked up and down the side line, his gaze
fixed anxiously on the teams. But time had been
called for Lanny, who had had his breath pretty
well knocked out of him in the tackle, and Dick<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>
turned tentatively to where McCoy sat further along
the bench, blanket-wrapped, his eyes too bent intently
on the field. But Lanny was soon up again,
and, had you been sitting next to McCoy, you’d
have heard a sigh of disappointment.</p>

<p>Chester Cottrell thumped the lineman on the
back, hoarsely encouraging and threatening. Lanny
pulled his head-guard on again and the whistle
shrilled. The backs sprang to their places and Cottrell
gave the signal. Tupper received the ball and
hurled himself at the right of the line, but the Blue
held and there was no gain. Cottrell scolded and
raged. A criss-cross sent Lanny three yards
through left guard, and it was third down with
seven to go, the pigskin on the twenty-three. On
the side line Morris was trotting slowly up and
down, casting eager, inquiring glances at Dick’s inscrutable
face.</p>

<p>“Signals!” shrieked Cottrell. “Get into it now,
Clearfield! Make this go! Signals! 81—29—61!”</p>

<p>“Watch for a forward!” called the Springdale
quarter from under his goal. “Come back, Holman!
Break this up, Springdale!”</p>

<p>“81—29—61!”</p>

<p>The ball went to Chester, Lanny and Tupper<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
swept to the right and hurled themselves at tackle,
Chester, his back to the enemy, hugged the ball.
Confusion reigned. The left of the Springdale line
broke. Then Beaton sprang ahead, took the ball
at a hand-pass, and slid through the center, was
tackled, plunged on, fighting and squirming, went
down with two Springdale backs on him and finally
grunted “Down!” The whistle blew and the referee
sprang at the pile-up and heeled the spot.
“Fourth down!” he called. “Two to go!”</p>

<p>On the side line Morris tugged at his sweater and
cast an impatient look at Dick. But the latter shook
his head and Morris walked back to the bench and
sat down again.</p>

<p>“They’ve got two yards to go, Dick,” he said
doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Yes, and they can do it, Morris. Your time
will come. Wait.”</p>

<p>And do it they did, Lanny himself squeezing
through between center and left guard for just
enough to secure first down. The ball was now on
the thirteen yards and Clearfield was yelling like
so many Comanche Indians, while steady cheers
for Springdale rolled across the field. Cottrell
hurried the fellows back into place, called his signal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>
and hurled Beaton at left tackle. Two yards
resulted. Springdale was stiffening now under the
shadow of her goal. Beaton was yanked to his feet,
and hobbled back to position.</p>

<p>“98—49—32!”</p>

<p>The lines set and the backs crouched.</p>

<p>“98—49—32!”</p>

<p>Back came the ball, Lanny and Tupper plunged at
the left of the line, Beaton sprang forward and—</p>

<p>“<em>Ball! Ball!</em>” cried Chester. Beaton had fumbled!
A Springdale lineman hurled himself past
with a mighty rasping of canvas and plunged forward.
Chester was tossed aside. A muffled voice
called “Down!” and the whistle blew.</p>

<p>“Springdale’s ball!” cried the referee. “First
down! Ten to go!”</p>

<p>A groan of disappointment arose from the Clearfield
stand, but the blue pennants waved mightily
and two hundred Springdale voices burst into wild
acclaim. Beaton, with miserable face, hung his
head as the Blue’s quarter took command. But
Lanny shouted encouragement:</p>

<p>“Never mind that, fellows! Let’s get it back!
Now play, play!”</p>

<p>Springdale hurled her fullback through for a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span>
scant three, made two more around the left end
and then punted from under her goal. Her line
held fast and the ball went flying up the field to
Cottrell, who made a fair catch on the thirty-eight
yards.</p>

<p>Then the journey back began. Lanny got
through the left for four yards and Beaton was
stopped for no gain. Then the quarter came to
an end. Dick sent Kent in for Arthur Beaton, Todd
for Partridge and Toll for Felker.</p>

<p>A minute later the teams lined up once more on
the Blue’s thirty-four yards. On the next play
Springdale was caught off-side and Clearfield gained
five yards. Lanny tried a wide run around left
end and made a scant three yards. With three to go
on fourth down, Lanny punted. The ball went
over the line and was brought back to the twenty.
Springdale made first down in three plays through
Cable. The latter was hurt and Robey went in for
him. A forward pass, following an unsuccessful
try at center, gained six and Sawtell added two
past Scott. Norton went back, but the ball was
passed to left halfback and that player got around
Merrick for four, securing first down on his own
forty-three yards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span></p>

<p>Springdale pulled her line apart and scattered her
backs to the right of center across the field. Clearfield
shifted to meet the formation. The ball went
to left half on a long pass from center and he raced
around the short side of his line. But he only made
three on the play. A fake-kick resulted in a try
at a forward, but Merrick broke it up, and, with
seven to go on fourth down, Springdale punted to
the Purple’s twenty-four. Lanny caught and got
back eight yards before he was stopped. Cottrell
again tried a delayed pass, but the enemy got
through and downed Beaton for a loss of two yards.
A criss-cross made five through right tackle. On
the next play Cottrell took the ball for a try around
right end but was pulled down behind his line, and
it was fourth down with nine to go. Cottrell was
plainly used-up and Dick sent in Hull. Chester
received a fine ovation as he came off.</p>

<p>Hull, after a conference with Lanny, sent Beaton
back and the ball went to Tupper, who squirmed
through outside left tackle and, evading tacklers,
managed to make it first down near the side line.
Hull displayed a lot of ginger and the plays began to
go off faster. With Lanny back in kicking position,
a straight plunge by Beaton took the ball to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span>
middle of the field. Lanny secured the needed two
yards past left tackle.</p>

<p>Hull failed at a run around his own right wing
and on the next play got off a fine lateral pass to
Merrick, who made eight yards before he was
thrown. Beaton plugged the center for four and
a first down. A fumble was recovered by Beaton
for a loss of six yards, but to offset that Springdale
was detected holding in the line and the ball
went back again. A forward pass from delayed
play, Beaton to Tupper, almost got that youth free
for a touchdown, but the Springdale quarter
stopped him on the Blue’s twenty-seven. Three tries
gained but four yards and Beaton hurled to Merrick.
But the throw was short and a Springdale end
got the ball and ran it back to the thirty-six.</p>

<p>Springdale failed to gain in two attempts and
punted to Lanny. After romping half-way across
the field he was pulled down for no gain. Lanny
tried the left end and made two, Beaton failed to
get through right guard and Lanny punted to
Springdale’s thirty-three yards. Springdale put in
three new linesmen and a substitute fullback.
McCoy went in for Tupper. There was six minutes
to play now. Springdale was no longer able to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span>
gain through the line and tried wide-formation attacks,
with the runner hunting a hole wherever he
could find it. She gained on two such plays and
made first down on a forward pass. She was
showing the strain now and her forwards were
weakening. Another attempt at a forward pass
from her forty-five-yard line failed and she punted
to the Purple’s thirty. Hull caught and squirmed
and dodged back through half the opposing team,
being finally halted on his forty-eight yards.</p>

<p>Time was now nearly up. Dick sent in Bryan
for Merrick and Brimmer for Haley. Haley had
been pretty badly used and was distinctly groggy as
he was led off. Bryan brought instructions and the
Purple players gathered in a group and listened to
them. The linesman announced four minutes to
play as the teams faced each other once more. Hull
sent McCoy at the center and gained four, sent the
same player against the right of the line and made
two. Then Lanny sped past left tackle and barely
gained first down on the opponent’s forty-two yards.
Beaton fought through center for three. Then, with
Beaton back, Number 8 was tried again and Toll
caught the pass for a twelve-yard gain and almost
got free for a run. Clearfield’s supporters were on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span>
their feet now, imploring a touchdown, and Springdale
was cheering steadily, doggedly. Springdale
put in a fresh center and a new left half, and Dick
substituted Arthur Beaton for Kent.</p>

<p>With the pigskin just back of the Blue’s twenty-eight
yards, near the right side line, Hull sent
McCoy around the long-field end for a scant gain
of two yards. Then Beaton made four between
left guard and center. A delayed pass, with Lanny
carrying, added three. With Lanny back in kicking
position, Hull himself took the pigskin past right
tackle for two and made it first down on Springdale’s
seventeen.</p>

<p>On the bench Dick nodded to Morris.</p>

<p>Beaton tried the left of the Blue’s line and secured
a scant yard. Springdale called time and
administered to her right guard. Lanny attempted
to get past left tackle but was pushed back. Springdale
again asked for time. And as the whistle
blew a sudden cheer burst from the Clearfield section.
On to the field raced two purple-stockinged
warriors. One was Chester Cottrell and the other
Morris Brent. Springdale in imagination saw the
game slip from them then. It would be no trick for
Brent to drop or place-kick from the seventeen-yards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span></p>

<p>“All right, Perry,” called Chester. “Sorry!
Let’s have that head-guard.”</p>

<p>The players clustered around Morris and thumped
him ecstatically. Perry Hull trotted disconsolately
off and the whistle blew again. Clearfield sprang
back to position. Beaton, following Hull from the
field and dragging his feet wearily as he went,
offered a jumbled, inarticulate prayer for victory.</p>

<p>“All right now, Clearfield!” shouted Chester
cheerily. “Here’s where we score! Everyone into
this hard!”</p>

<p>On the bench, Fudge Shaw, taking the place beside
Dick left vacant by Morris, whispered nervously:
“Is he g-g-going to t-t-t-try it now, D-D-Dick?”</p>

<p>Dick, his hands clutching his crutches tensely, his
face rather white and strained, nodded without turning.
Fudge gave vent to a huge sigh.</p>

<p>“Gee!” he muttered fervently. “I hope it g-g-goes!”</p>

<p>Then Cottrell’s voice came sharply across the field
again:</p>

<p>“Brent back! Left tackle over!”</p>

<p>Morris slowly retreated to kicking distance.</p>

<p>“<em>Block this!</em>” shouted Springdale. “<em>Block this
kick! Get through and block it!</em>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span></p>

<p>Chester followed Morris back and knelt in front
of him. “All right?” he asked, looking up.</p>

<p>Morris nodded, shuffling on his feet. Chester
patted the ground with his hand. Morris looked
for an instant at the cross-bar and edged back
another foot or so.</p>

<p>“A little more this way,” he said.</p>

<p>“<em>Block this, Springdale!</em>” implored the Blue’s
quarter, dodging back and forth behind the line.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Morris.</p>

<p>Quiet fell over the field. The Clearfield linemen
crouched. Lanny, behind his own left guard, poised
tensely. Across from him, Tupper stood ready to
guard the kicker. Todd was between Beaton and
Wayland on the right of the line. Chester, facing
the left, one knee on the ground, held his hands
toward the center.</p>

<p>“Signals!” he shouted briskly. “44—18—110!”</p>

<p>Morris gave a final look at the cross-bar. The
enemy, panting, gasping, swayed restively.</p>

<p>“44—18—110!”</p>

<p>“<em>Block it! Block it!</em>” shrieked the defenders.</p>

<p>Back sped the ball to Chester’s outstretched hands.
The lines heaved. Canvas rasped against canvas,
bodies strained, cries and grunts from labored lungs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span>
made pandemonium for a moment. Morris stepped
and swung his leg. Half a dozen blue-clad arms
reached in air. The Springdale right end broke
through, but met Lanny and went hurtling aside toward
the line. And then, just as the Springdale forwards
came charging through, Chester, the ball snuggled
in the crook of his left elbow, sprang up and
darted straight ahead toward the left of the field!</p>

<p>Ahead of him ran Lanny, but Lanny had little to
do. Springdale was tricked. There had been not the
slightest doubt in the mind of any of them but
that Brent’s appearance at that moment meant a
try for goal. The line, from end to end, had been
intent upon but one thing, and that was to break
through at any cost and block the kick. Strengthening
the right of the Clearfield line had drawn an
extra Springdale back to that side and now Chester
was in slight danger of being stopped. Lanny threw
himself in front of the Springdale quarter and
sent that frantic youth rolling head over heels, and
Chester, striking in toward the goal line, crossed it
without opposition! It was not until he was almost
behind the nearer post that hostile arms dragged
him to earth and he was smothered by angry blue-stockinged
defenders!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span></p>

<p>Cheers thundered from the stand, the bass drum
thumped a pæan of victory, caps and megaphones
sailed into the air, and, on the bench, a round-faced
youth sat silent in wondering and awed delight.
The Secret Play had won!</p>

<p>Two minutes later Nelson Beaton, racing back to
the field, kicked the goal that added another point
to that glorious 6, and forty seconds after that the
final whistle shrilled and George Cotner, snatching
the ball from the umpire, raced into the throng with
it, dodging the <a href="#i_frontis">ecstatic youths</a> who, flowing onto
the field, <a href="#i_frontis">were capturing the players and raising
them shoulder-high</a> while the band played unheard
and a babel of voices proclaimed Clearfield’s victory!</p>

<p>Ten minutes later still, when Toby Sears was
standing perilously on the railing of the grandstand
leading the cheers, a hoarse voice demanded
“Lovering! We—want—Coach—Lovering!” The
demand was multiplied by two hundred voices, and
willing emissaries darted away in search of him.
But they didn’t find him. Dick, a contented smile
on his face, was blocks away, chugging home in Eli.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
